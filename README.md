# NYC Civic Engagement
Driving hyper local civic engagement and allocation of resources through data.

## Goal:
Leverage publicly available data-sets and mapping technology to allow people to see problems in their communities, and where they can volunteer to help address them.  Additionally, we'd like to provide resources for agencies and non profits to make informed efforts about where to allocate their resources, and where they can get people assist with their efforts.


## TODO
1. Refactor into Angular 2
1. Turn css into sass and DRY it out
1. Prevent one org from taking over all the listings
1. Release and promote
1. More social media tie ins and feedback
1. Webpack (nice to have but not required)
1. Rewrite map to enable proper crossfade (nice to have but not required)
