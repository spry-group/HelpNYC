Through our innovative programs, which are part of the class curricula, accomplished authors visit high-needs Pre-K-12th-grade classrooms to guide students in creating their own writing projects based on the theme of the author's book. You need no experience or training to volunteer. As a writing or research coach, or on a field trip, you'll support and encourage students as they work. These four writing workshops need your help at a high school in the Bronx. To sign up for one or more class sessions, contact volunteer@behindthebook.org with program code IC12IZ-C and the time slot(s) you choose. We'll supply more information when you're confirmed. Date: Tuesday, March 12th Times (choose 1 or more slots): 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM, 12:45 -1:45 PM, 1:45 - 2:45 PM and/or 2:50 - 3:50 PM Volunteer Role: Writing coach About the program: To consider issues of cultural identity, class, and gentrification, 12th-graders read Pride by Ibi Zoboi, a modern take on Jane Austen&rsquo;s Pride and Prejudice set in Bushwick, a historically marginalized community of color. Students will address the question: What is the price of change? in short fiction pieces that feature a character who must adapt to a significant life event. Writing coaches will support small groups as they polish their work.

Why Take the Challenge? While we have made great progress in reducing incidence and death rates of those 50 or older over the last decade through the prevention and early detection of colorectal cancer through screening - the simple fact is colorectal cancer is still the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death. And, incidence rates and death of those under 50 have increased at an alarming rate each year. In 2018 over 135,000 (estimated) Americans will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer and over 50,000 Americans will lose their battle with the disease. Most frustrating is the fact that most of these cases could be prevented with early detection. If caught early the 5 year survival rate is 90%. Where do the funds raised go? Funds raised by teams and individuals helps provide: Free educational materials and our participation in outreach events in communities around the country; A national tour of our educational inflatable colon - the Rollin&rsquo; Colon; Local, state, national and global programs that promote colorectal cancer prevention and early detection; Awards to young colorectal cancer investigators presenting at the world&rsquo;s premier societies and conferences; Funding to support the nation&rsquo;s ONLY Summit focused on early age onset colorectal cancer. The Colon Cancer Challenge offers survivors, and family and friends of those affected by colorectal cancer, a unique opportunity to raise public awareness and contribute to the fight against this often fatal, yet preventable disease.

Tutors will coordinate with each other, and work closely with the instructor. Tutors will be supported through the process by the City Tutors staff. We will support the Monday and Wednesday course from 2 - 3:15 pm. Let us know which course date works for you. Our course support will be determined based on tutor time availability. This is a great opportunity especially for students who are majoring (or have already earned a degree) in sociology, or who are social science majors/minors. All majors are welcome to apply. Tutors will get to enhance their understanding of writing composition and gain professional experience and references that they can leverage for future opportunities. As a tutor, you would identify students struggling, provide feedback to the instructor regarding students' concerns and difficulties that can lead to changes in future lessons, conduct virtual study groups, and allow students to submit parts of their writing for review before final drafts are submitted. All tutors are also expected to complete a four session comprehensive, professional training regimen over the course of the semester. 6 hours of live training, plus another hour and a half for orientation. This is a commitment of 7.5 hours of in person training, and 4 hours of supplemental training for a total of 11.5 hours of training over the course of the Spring semester. Training days will be determined based on your schedule and that of the Tutor Training Coordinators. CT's embedded tutoring program has been successful in helping students gain access to support that they otherwise would not have received, given their limited time spent on campus. Having a tutor in the class early in the semester will allow us to employ strategies to reduce withdrawals and student failure rates. Your work with us would help the students&rsquo; overall subject area performance, and help us improve this educational support model, reaching more students and departments with comprehensive academic support.

Our workshops are approximately 30-40, boys and girls, and most of our students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch at school.

The commitment for each volunteer is a single Saturday and single Sunday from 8:30 am to 4:30 pm. For Weekend 1, volunteers should have a working knowledge of design thinking and product management processes, and an intermediate understanding of HTML & CSS. For Weekend 2, volunteers should have programming experience in any language.
