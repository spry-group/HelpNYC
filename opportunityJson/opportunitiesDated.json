Are you looking to gain professional experience across social media platforms and trying to hone your marketing skills? Do you have an interest in helping children in the foster system? CASA of Union County&rsquo;s Marketing Intern position may be exactly what you are looking for! Every year more than half a million abused and neglected children are in need of safe, permanent, nurturing homes. Too many spend years moving from one temporary home to another. They are more likely than other children to face homelessness, unemployment, even prison as adults. CASA was created to make sure the abuse and neglect these children originally suffered at home doesn't continue as abuse and neglect at the hands of the system. CASA trains advocates who are appointed by judges to be a voice for these children in court. The result is that a child is placed into a safe, loving home where he or she can thrive. Our marketing and development team makes sure that the organization has the resources necessary to do this critical work. CASA of Union County is looking for a college or graduate student to volunteer this Fall to help the marketing and development team continue to make CASA thrive. The student would commit to working approximately 10-15 hours per week from September through early December. Duties may include: creating social media posts assisting in maintaining and updating the organization website drafting articles for the monthly newsletter researching press opportunities submitting press releases assisting at recruitment events (if in-person recruitment is an option due to Covid-19) helping promote, prepare for and assist during such upcoming events as the virtual Gala, and exploring potential grant opportunities. Potential volunteers should have a passion for helping children, understand and have experience with various social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, and have excellent written communication and research skills. Please note: We hope this internship will be on-site in our Elizabeth office.

Volunteers are the heart of the American Cancer Society and events like Making Strides walks simply could not happen without you. Your support will bring you community together with determination, hope, empathy, caring, and passion, so no one has to walk alone. The American Cancer Society Making Strides Against Breast Cancer walks raise awareness and funds to save lives from breast cancer. Each event is a noncompetitive 5 mile walk that brings people together to make a difference for everyone who has been touched by breast cancer. The events raise money to fund innovative research, provide free information and support, and to help people reduce their breast cancer risk or find it early when it's most treatable. From the opening ceremony to the post-walk entertainment, a Making Strides event is a celebration of survivors and opportunity to remember loved-ones lost.
