It is the nation's largest art parade and one of New York City's greatest summer events. Founded in 1983 by Coney Island USA, the not-for-profit arts organization that also produces the Coney island Circus Sideshow, the Mermaid Parade pays homage to Coney Island's forgotten Mardi Gras which lasted from 1903 to 1954, and draws from a host of other sources resulting in a wonderful and wacky event that is unique to Coney Island. The Mermaid Parade celebrates the sand, the sea, the salt air and the beginning of summer, as well as the history and mythology of Coney Island, Coney Island pride, and artistic self-expression. Participants dress in hand-made costumes as Mermaids, Neptunes, various sea creatures, the occasional wandering lighthouse, Coney Island post card or amusement ride, as well as antique cars, marching bands, drill teams, and the odd yacht pulled on flatbed. WHAT WE'LL BE DOING: Banner carriers, parade marshal and crowd control. WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW: 18 years and older to volunteer for this parade. Dressing up in costume is prohibited. A t-shirt will be given. WHERE TO MEET: Check in at the volunteer station located in the parking lot on Surf Ave. and between W. 21st & W. 22nd Street. CONEY ISLAND USA: Coney Island USA is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation based in the amusement park area of the Coney Island neighborhood of Brooklyn New York. In existence since 1983, Coney Island USA has developed and produces a number of different programs including some of New York Citys best loved summer programming, such as the Mermaid Parade and the Coney Island Circus Sideshow. Coney Island USA also operates the Coney Island Museum and produces Ask the Experts, Burlesque at the Beach, the Coney Island Tattoo and Motorcycle Festival, Creepshow at the Freakshow, and the Coney Island Sideshow School.

This is why our volunteers are so important and make such a difference. It's easy to learn and fun to do. On average, volunteers sort ~2,000 lbs of fabric every week! FABSCRAP works because of the enthusiasm and effort of people like you. WHAT WE'LL BE DOING: Each session is approximately 3 hours long with 8 positions available.

(2.5 hours) Shop for fabric To thank you for your time, your first 5 lbs of fabric are FREE, and you'll get the discount student rate ($3/lb) if you'd like to purchase additional material. WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW: We welcome all sorters over the age of 18! Please... Dress comfortably and wear comfortable shoes Bring an extra bag to carry your free fabric home We play music, but feel free to bring headphones There is a cafe at the Brooklyn Army Terminal, but bring water and snacks if you need them The warehouse can be warm in the summer!

Camp AmeriKids is a one-week free summer camp for youth ages 8-16 who are infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS and/or sickle cell disease. We work with youth who might not normally be able to attend camp because of medical concerns and provide them with a traditional summer camp experience - all free of charge. We have a comprehensive medical team living at camp, available 24/7, which allows youth living with sickle cell, HIV/AIDS and other chronic illnesses to have a great time at camp while their families can be assured their health and well-being are monitored. In addition to our healthcare staff, we have a Wellness team overseen by a mental health professional. There is one child specialist assigned to each age group to assist counselors and staff members in managing any challenges associated with living in a new environment. The entire camp staff volunteer their time and energy to provide this incredible one-week experience for our youth. While we understand the difficulty in fully disengaging from the outside world, we expect volunteers to be present and engaged at all times to help create a fun, loving and safe environment for both staff and campers. Volunteers are given two nights off after campers have gone to bed and one period off each day to take a nap, grab a coffee or call home. Besides daily lessons in dance, drama, sports, arts & crafts, spoken word and more, we have a slew of special events. These include an evening luau, day at the carnival, a talent show and of course - campfires and s&rsquo;mores! Given the responsibilities involved in caring for children and the unique nature of our program, we take every precaution and screen all applicants extensively to ensure a good match. All volunteers are provided with housing and meals for the week. Mandatory orientation on Saturday, August 3 rd will acquaint you with camp and fellow volunteers to prepare before the campers arrive. Descriptions for cabin counselors, program and operations staff and preferred qualifications are below. To apply, please fill out a Volunteer Application online. For more information, email Executive Director Chloe Ettari at cettari@elm-project.org. CABIN COUNSELORS A team of counselors is responsible for the 24-hour supervision of a cabin and maintains a 2:1 camper to counselor ratio. The cabin counselor&rsquo;s enthusiastic participation in all aspects of camp is crucial in creating a memorable experience for our campers. We expect counselors to be completely engaged and participate in the fun alongside the kids - whether that&rsquo;s hopping in the pool, trying a new sport, or dancing on stage! Counselors are expected to be leaders and role models, as well as sources of energy and ideas. They are a key part of the Camp AmeriKids community. Qualifications Experience working with children Excellent team player and leadership skills Strong interpersonal and communications skills Flexible, energetic and creative (having skills or talents to teach campers is a plus!) Comfortable multi-tasking and working in a fast-paced, changing work environment Ability to relate well to people from diverse backgrounds and maintain confidentiality Ability to maintain a positive attitude under stress Passion for our mission and desire to work with children in a camp setting Program Staff Every summer we welcome a phenomenal crew of talented artists, performers and teachers from around the world to share their skills and experiences with our campers. Program staff facilitate learning and fun for campers in their area of expertise (i.e. dance, arts & crafts, sports). Each day, cabins will visit different program areas and participate in 45-minute activity periods. We expect program staff to come prepared with activities for campers of various age groups to learn and participate in - and be flexible when the schedule changes! In addition, we offer older campers (ages 12-16) the opportunity to choose a dedicated program area to attend every afternoon and work on a \\\"weekly project\\\" with a larger group. Campers will showcase their work on the last evening at our Talent Show - i.e. performing a short play, reciting original poetry, singing a song, or performing a choreographed group dance. Qualifications Personal or professional experience in at least one of the following areas: dance, theatre, arts & crafts, music, spoken word/poetry, sports, nature or film. If you have skills or talents not listed, we encourage you to apply and let us know what new program area you can teach!
