In 1998, the Children&rsquo;s Defense Fund reported that violent crime by young people ages 10-17 peaks between 3 and 7 PM; children and teens in poor neighborhoods are struggling for direction and positive opportunities are needed to keep them safe and on-track; a great majority of all American fourth graders cannot read or do math at grade level, including more than five of six black children. In addition, a study published in Pediatrics magazine found that eighth graders who were left alone after school reported greater use of cigarettes, marijuana, and alcohol than those in adult-supervised settings. Current research indicates that supervised after-school and summer programs not only keep children safe and out of trouble, they also significantly improve their academic achievement. PROJECT DESCRIPTION Teaching high-risk, inner-city Youth the skills to become successful in life is at the core of the ACN SUMMER YOUTH CAPACITY BUILDING program. The Four(4) major components of the program are: *Homework Assistance through tutoring, mentoring and Use of Computer labs. *Nutrition Education to promote healthy lifestyles and Combat Obesity. *Life Skills which are integrated throughout all phases of the program. *Soccer Instructions where participants engage in fun physical fitness, enjoy the camaraderie of playing in a soccer team format with friends and peers, and learn to become responsible adolescents and adults. The summer After-School Program- will serve approximately 600 children which includes academic tutoring five(5) hours per week and Soccer Instruction, Health and life skills education ten(10) hours per week. Participants will receive Soccer Instruction in professional settings and practice skills in team format play. They will learn about the rules of the game, etiquette, sportsmanship, positive attitudes, fair play, self-esteem, taking responsibility for choices and management of emotions. These life skills are integrated throughout the Soccer program, and instructors routinely demonstrate how they apply to situations in all aspects of life. Nutrition and Healthy lifestyles are stressed both in the Classroom setting and on the Soccer Field. Healthy Snacks will be provided. The ACN YOUTH CAPACITY BUILDING program is Fortunate to have a corpse of Volunteers willing to dedicate to the program and are available to work with the children on improving their academic skills. Seeking Volunteers from some of the community based Universities/colleges who will take an active role in the homework area, working individually with the students using current homework assignments. In the computer lab, Volunteer tutors will help the students improve their keyboarding skills and show them how to use the computer for research. They will read aloud with the students and give quizzes on tapes and videos to improve comprehension. When the college/university students volunteers are not on campus, volunteers from local Churches will assume the role of tutors.

We bring critical resources and deep cultural competency to help Asian communities find refuge, recovery, and renewal. Purpose/Overview: The Later in Life program started in 2012 to address the needs and challenges of older adult (age 50 and above) survivors of gender-based violence. 20% of Womankind&rsquo;s clients are above the age of 50; the LIL program works to ensure that their needs are represented both internally (through our services and staff) and externally (through our advocacy efforts). This position will support our outreach efforts to the Chinese population in Queens or Manhattan (depending on the volunteer&rsquo;s preference), and will help with facilitating workshops and groups. There are two phases to this position. The first phase will require the volunteer to assist staff in reaching out to places that older Chinese adults frequent in an effort to establish a partnership. The second phase will initiate once the partnership is established. The volunteer will begin to conduct workshops and groups in the site. The larger goal of this position is twofold: first, to create awareness around abuse in later life and connect survivors with services; second, to foster an active aging lifestyle among older adults through the workshops and groups. Supervisor: Miyoung Kim, MS, MA, L-CAT, R-DMT, Expressive Therapies Ph.D. student/ Later in Life Advocate Location: This position will be based in either Queens or Manhattan, and will require traveling between the Womankind community office and a partnered organization (possibly senior center, adult day care center, etc.) Key Responsibilities: Visit locations in Queens/ Manhattan (around Womankind&rsquo;s community office) that Chinese older adults frequent: senior centers, adult day care centers, etc. Build a partnership with at least one possible site for us to conduct workshops and groups Conduct workshops around abuse in later life at sites at least once a month Facilitate support groups at sites on a weekly basis (this can be art groups, dance groups, etc. - depends on the comfort level of the volunteer) Expected Time Commitment: May 2018 (or as soon as possible) through April 2019 Schedule: Two weekdays per week, 4 hours per day (minimum). In the beginning, the volunteer will use the two days to visit possible sites and go through trainings for this position. After establishing partnerships, the two days will revolve around facilitating groups/ workshops and supervision. Hours will be flexible during the two days depending on the partnerships established (most likely will be in the earlier part of the day). Qualifications: Must be proficient in Mandarin and/or Cantonese. Should have a strong interest in working with older adults. No prior experience with conducting workshops or facilitating groups required - trainings will be provided. An interest in wellness activities/therapy strongly preferred. Orientation and Training Requirements: Volunteer will receive ongoing supervision and training as needed throughout this position. In the first couple of months, the volunteer will receive these trainings before we execute the workshops and groups: Abuse in Later Life Training (which will cover the types of abuse that occur in later life, ageism, and active aging) How to conduct presentations training Facilitating groups training Any other Womankind trainings will be made available (and optional) for the volunteer Support/Continuing Education: Individual supervision will be provided on a weekly basis for at least an hour. Supervisor will guide the volunteer in reaching out to places and building professional relationships. Supervisor will also assist the volunteer in conducting workshops and facilitating wellness groups. Volunteer will also receive support from the Later in Life Program Manager as needed. Volunteer will participate in a monthly Later in Life team meeting. Benefits: Professional mentorship Supervision credits if volunteer is a LCAT candidate Gain experience with conducting workshops and public speaking Learn to create and facilitate wellness groups Opportunities for advancement within Womankind Opportunities for growth as volunteer will be equipped with tools to work with gender-based violence survivors Opportunities to teach specific skills if volunteer is passionate about certain creative activities (knitting, yoga, craft, dance, cooking, etc.) Selection process: Submit a resume and cover letter to the Later in Life Program Manager, Kayla Chan ( kchan@iamwk.org) with the email title \\\"Later in Life Volunteer\\\".

Event volunteers will be given a pass to the festival in exchange for their work engaging the lines into the venue and at our table in the Warped tent. Responsibilities will include set up and breakdown, clearly conveying our mission to attendees, discussing the raffle and petition drive with interested parties, directing concertgoers to take online actions, collecting petition signatures, conducting the giveaway and occasionally mitigating conflict with hardline 2A'ers where necessary. To be considered for this gig, you must be passionate and knowledgeable about common sense gun control legislation as well as comfortable and adept at de-escalating tense exchanges with folks opposed to our mission (as there WILL be some). Comfort with using a bullhorn is a plus! Transportation and overnight accommodation are not provided. You will have the opportunity to catch some acts as the Warped tent breaks down at 6pm and the show goes for hours beyond that. This opportunity requires one volunteer to act as lead and one as assistant. Lead must be available for an online training session on Monday July 23rd, or have access to archived video of the session and view it before the event date. Volunteers must also have a smartphone for communication with Warped Tour point person and each other. Please indicate in your response whether you are interested in the \\\"lead\\\" or \\\"assistant\\\" position.
