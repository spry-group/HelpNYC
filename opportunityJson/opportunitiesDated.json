CASA trains volunteers to become advocates who are then appointed by judges to be a voice for these children in court and in their community. The goal is for each child to be placed into a safe, loving home where he/she have permanency and can thrive. Interns with CASA of Union County volunteer with our development and program staff to ensure the organization has the resources and support necessary to do this critical work. CASA of Union County seeks interns each semester to help staff continue to make CASA thrive and reach as many abused, neglected and abandoned children as possible. Some recent intern responsibilities include: Entering and analyzing case data; Organizing and prepping for special events; Developing outreach materials and engaging in community outreach; Drafting articles for newsletters; Creating social media content; Updating paper and digital case files for program staff; Attending court with staff and volunteer advocates; Preparing training materials; Assisting with volunteer recognition; and Researching opportunities to expand the volunteer base.

Don't Walk By is a project of the Rescue Alliance, a coalition of faith-based organizations, including The Salvation Army, engaged in addressing homelessness and housing fragility. Each Saturday in February, in one of four sections of Manhattan per Saturday (uptown, eastside, westside, and downtown), volunteer teams walk the streets and subways of an assigned area engaging with homeless neighbors they may encounter distributing small items (eg. hygiene kits, clean socks, etc.) and extending an invitation to dinner at an anchor church. If accepted, guests are offered a van trip to the church. At the anchor church, guests are provided a dignified sit-down dinner (eg. tablecloths, centerpieces, printed menus, servers, etc.). Every guest is invited to spend the evening housed in a Rescue Alliance member/partner shelter (eg. NYC Rescue Mission, All Angels' Church). Our hope is that accepting this offer will lead to longer-term case management, the end goal being life-transformation that includes dignity, stable housing, independence, and, where needed, sobriety. In addition to a meal and invitation to shelter, other services provided at the anchor church include: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit sign-up Distribution of backpacks, winter coats, SafeLink cell phones, and other items Legal advice Medical services including HIV testing, optometry w/ free glasses, podiatry, blood pressure checks, etc. Referrals to detox, drug and alcohol rehabilitation, and mental health services This year, The Salvation Army is the lead coordinator of this outreach working with multiple Rescue Alliance members/partners (eg. Bowery Mission, Hope For New York, NYC Relief, New York Presbyterian Hospital, etc.) each taking lead over several included functions. You can be part of this opportunity to support our homeless neighbors through multiple volunteer roles (eg. street team member or leader, driver, driver's assistant, hosts, table hosts, runners, servers).
