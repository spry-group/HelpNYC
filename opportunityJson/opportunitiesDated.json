Every four minutes someone is diagnosed with a blood cancer. It can happen to anyone at any time. But so can a cure - a marrow transplant. The cure for blood cancer is in the hands of ordinary people. Most of us won&rsquo;t have a marrow donor in our family and Be The Match matches volunteer marrow donors with patients who need them.

Good Grief was created in 2004 and serves over 550 participants every month.

In order to meet the needs of urban youth, Good Grief created In Community, a program that supports underserved children and families.

In Community will reduce isolation by creating a community of children of similar ages who have experienced loss, as well as give them the tools to develop healthy coping skills to adapt to their current and other adversities they may experience.

We accept all offers of volunteerism on any day. We want partners also to help us meet with students to organize our market so we can expand to a real farmers market. Right now, students and teachers serve fresh orange juice and fresh juices at the morning market. We plan to expand hours - hopefully to afterschool - and also offerings - parfaits, smoothies, icies, and more... Can you help us build? Please send us an email at info@seedsinthemiddle.org and tell us what you can do and what hours you are available. Students can also meet during their lunch hour : 11:15- 12 noon Flatbush is one of the e neighborhoods ranked among NYC's most food-insecure zones, by the NYC Health Dept. and multiple studies. There is limited access to fruits and vegetables and overwhelming junk food options. These neighborhoods have among the highest obesity, diabetes, heart disease rates in the city - mainly due to lack of access to affordable fresh produce and healthy activities. Be the change! We also plan to hold an all-day Saturday market in June - so you can also volunteer for that. But again - we take all offers! HELP TEACHERS AND STUDENTS BUILD THEIR GARDEN HELP STUDENTS IN THEIR HIP2B HEALTHY MARKET and help us expand to a full farmers market - run by students! We give community service credits. A little more detail below - FYI - if you are a chef or love to cook and want to share healthy eating, help us host Chef Nights at schools... Obligation - Weekday night 4-8 pm Looking for anyone who wants to work with students and families and educators and the local commuity to effect sustainable change by building local capacity.

East Harlem has the highest unmet need for after school programming of any neighborhood in NYC. By volunteering you will provide much needed out-of-school time safety - and arts programming. At Groove With Me, we strive to provide a forum for girls to develop critical thinking skills as well as a growth mindset through Dance. Summer Programming 2018 Schedule Will Offer 2 Sessions: Classes meet 1x per week for 1 hour Session 1 will run from July 2th - July 26th (4 weeks) Session 2 will run from July 30th- August 16th (3 weeks) Teachers can select which session to teach.

The time commitment can be as little as 2 hours a day to several days a week -- depending on how much time you want to share. As a volunteer you can feed the hungry at soup kitchens and food pantries or by delivering meals to homebound elderly. You can visit the sick as a Hospice volunteer or nursing home friendly visitor.

Some volunteers help by providing administrative support at local non-profit organizations, while others assist local museums and cultural institutions as docents.

In 1998, the Children&rsquo;s Defense Fund reported that violent crime by young people ages 10-17 peaks between 3 and 7 PM; children and teens in poor neighborhoods are struggling for direction and positive opportunities are needed to keep them safe and on-track; a great majority of all American fourth graders cannot read or do math at grade level, including more than five of six black children. In addition, a study published in Pediatrics magazine found that eighth graders who were left alone after school reported greater use of cigarettes, marijuana, and alcohol than those in adult-supervised settings. Current research indicates that supervised after-school and summer programs not only keep children safe and out of trouble, they also significantly improve their academic achievement. PROJECT DESCRIPTION Teaching high-risk, inner-city Youth the skills to become successful in life is at the core of the ACN SUMMER YOUTH CAPACITY BUILDING program. The Four(4) major components of the program are: *Homework Assistance through tutoring, mentoring and Use of Computer labs. *Nutrition Education to promote healthy lifestyles and Combat Obesity. *Life Skills which are integrated throughout all phases of the program. *Soccer Instructions where participants engage in fun physical fitness, enjoy the camaraderie of playing in a soccer team format with friends and peers, and learn to become responsible adolescents and adults. The summer After-School Program- will serve approximately 600 children which includes academic tutoring five(5) hours per week and Soccer Instruction, Health and life skills education ten(10) hours per week. Participants will receive Soccer Instruction in professional settings and practice skills in team format play. They will learn about the rules of the game, etiquette, sportsmanship, positive attitudes, fair play, self-esteem, taking responsibility for choices and management of emotions. These life skills are integrated throughout the Soccer program, and instructors routinely demonstrate how they apply to situations in all aspects of life. Nutrition and Healthy lifestyles are stressed both in the Classroom setting and on the Soccer Field. Healthy Snacks will be provided. The ACN YOUTH CAPACITY BUILDING program is Fortunate to have a corpse of Volunteers willing to dedicate to the program and are available to work with the children on improving their academic skills. Seeking Volunteers from some of the community based Universities/colleges who will take an active role in the homework area, working individually with the students using current homework assignments. In the computer lab, Volunteer tutors will help the students improve their keyboarding skills and show them how to use the computer for research. They will read aloud with the students and give quizzes on tapes and videos to improve comprehension. When the college/university students volunteers are not on campus, volunteers from local Churches will assume the role of tutors.

The instructor uses pre-approved lesson plans and activities to help students become informed about the links between poverty and illiteracy while also teaching students the importance of planning in life with a segway into the importance of proper lesson planning for a literacy program. Students are challenged to break into teams, select from a group of random items and create their own lesson plans for a specific age group. The following week, each team visits a local shelter partnered with our organization and they host a 1-hour literacy program with the children in the shelter program. The program finishes off with a lesson in identifying literacy challenges in our own communities among our peers and is followed up with a subsequent literacy day for the community. The literacy day is planned by the students and all games are created or reinvented by the students. They invite their collective communities, family, and friends out to the event where students are awarded and recognized for their work. Lesson plans, activities, and supplies are provided to the instructor. The group will meet on Thursdays April-May. One Wednesday evening (6:30pm-7:30pm) is also required for the visit with homeless youth. The Literacy day event will be held on Saturday, May 19th from approximately 12pm-3pm.
