Citizen Schools brings volunteers to middle schools to teach hundreds of relevant subjects--and launch new dreams. At Citizen Schools, middle-school students work side by side with experts to explore new fields, learn new skills, and create something real for their community. Once a week, volunteer Citizen Teachers partner with middle schools in low-income communities to teach apprenticeships in a wide range of subjects. Teams and individuals from corporations, civic organizations, universities, and associations lead courses about things they're passionate about, exposing young people to new futures through ten weekly lessons. Each curriculum is designed to make academic and 21st Century standards connect to careers and real life. And each one culminates in a WOW!--a presentation of the students' work before an adult audience, building students' oral communication and teamwork skills. Independent studies show that Citizen Schools apprentices get better grades, have better attendance, and graduate at a higher rate than their peers--and that volunteers gain professional skills like teamwork, communication, project management, and leadership.

Graphic Design Internship at ClassWish.org! Work in NYC or Virtually We are recruiting outstanding graphic design students as interns for late Summer 2012 and the 2012-2013 school year (either or both!) to collaborate on the boldest nonprofit initiative we know. We are looking for passionate, energetic students with exceptional skills to create web page layouts, flyers, logos, etc. for ClassWish.org. This is an outstanding leadership opportunity in an innovative start-up nonprofit organization. Here is the problem we are tackling: K-12 schools in this country do not have enough resources to let children explore their potential and excel. Art supplies, books, computers, musical instruments, science equipment, sports equipment, and even paper for computers and printers are all in desperately short supply. Our Approach: ClassWish . org, an exciting new nonprofit, uses modern business practices and the latest marketing techniques to help 125,000 schools serving 56 million kids, inform, inspire and engage supporters. Teachers visit the site to create Wish Lists of the resources they need. People in the community can see exactly what is needed and contribute to help. About Us: The people behind ClassWish.org include such prominent education and business leaders as Adam Hirsch, former COO, Mashable; Laurie Coots, CMO, TBWA; Scott Cutler, EVP, New York Stock Exchange; Betsy Morgan, former CEO, Huffington Post; Nancy Pelz-Paget, Director, Education and Society Program, Aspen Institute; Sharon Robinson, CEO, American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education. Forbes Magazine liked our approach so much that they donated a full page to help raise awareness. Yo-Yo Ma, Tony Hawk and Dwight Howard are among the celebrities who have offered to help promote ClassWish.org. The work: Teachers and students are already getting supplies from ClassWish.org. Now, we need to develop attention-grabbing graphics so we can help more kids. You will take a leadership role and work with other highly motivated interns, established professionals, and directly with our co-founder. What do we offer? You will enhance your portfolio with projects that will be displayed on the Internet as well as in print, visible to potential future employers, and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you have helped children get the tools they need to perform at their best. If you want to gain great experience and do something you will always be proud of, send a cover letter and a resume to interns @ ClassWish . org. Impress us. This is competitive. FAQ Is this a business or a nonprofit? ClassWish is a nonprofit, but we use the latest techniques from the business world to make a leveraged, scalable and financially-self sustaining difference in the lives of tens of millions of children. This sounds ambitious! Daniel Burnham, the great Chicago architect, said \\\"Make no little plans; they have not the power to stir men&rsquo;s souls.\\\" (Nor women&rsquo;s, we hasten to add). Little plans also do not have the power to provide a better education to 56 million kids who deserve more than they are getting today. We face a crushing need in schools, have a solid plan to address it, and with your help, we intend to grow this very large and very fast. Where are you located? We are in Manhattan, conveniently located right across from Madison Square Garden. There are four express subway stops within one block. We will also hire interns to work remotely from other cities. I looked at your site and have some suggestions. Great! This is a collaborative project, and we want to hear from you. Is this a paid internship? We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your portfolio, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions. When will you select the interns? We&rsquo;re agile. When we see a great candidate, we extend an invitation immediately. We won&rsquo;t keep you waiting for a decision. What dates will the internship run? We are hiring for the spring semester, for the summer, and beyond. Tell us what you are looking for. What are the hours? We welcome full-time and part-time interns. Let us know what works for you. What will I need to bring? Brains, heart, passion, energy, a notebook computer, and a passion to make an immediate improvement to the education of tens of millions of children. Sounds exciting! How can I apply?

We offer four great benefits: Take on a leadership role Enhance your resume Make a difference Generate funds for college tuition and textbooks We are looking for passionate, energetic students with exceptional skills. This is an outstanding leadership opportunity in an innovative start-up nonprofit organization. About ClassWish ClassWish is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in NYC and working nationwide. Our initial focus was in providing resources for K-12 students. We are now turning attention to help generate funds for nonprofits and for college tuition and textbooks, as well. We offer high-achieving students unparalleled opportunities to assume responsibility, use their skills, gain experience, and make a difference--and provide relief from the cost of college tuition and textbooks. Here are the problems we are tackling: We are tackling two problems at once: Nonprofits need far more funding to fulfill their missions, and schools need far more resources for kids (books, computers, art supplies, musical instruments, science equipment, and sports equipment are all in desperately short supply). Students and their families are burdened by the skyrocketing cost of college tuition and textbooks. (By the way, be sure to see www.TuitionRevolution.org). Our Approach ClassWish is launching a new initiative to address these needs. Soon, students and their families will be able to earn an average of 8% of what they spend at stores, grocers, gas stations, restaurants, hotels, and airlines, and they will be able to direct that to their favorite schools, teachers, nonprofits, or even their own tuition and textbooks. What Campus Reps Will Do ClassWish Campus Reps will help raise awareness of this opportunity for students, professors, and their families to generate funding for schools, nonprofits, and college tuition. We will recruit a campus rep on each college campus. They, in turn, will recruit additional campus reps to focus on each of these areas: Greek life Residence halls Athletics Student government Student clubs and organizations Professors and administration Alumni Student media Social media Events Graphics Communications Marketing We Want to Hear From Outstanding Students Interested in becoming a Campus Rep? Send a brief cover letter and a resume to interns [AT] ClassWish.org. Looking for a great internship in NYC or virtually?

FAQ - Review ClassWish.org&rsquo;s outstanding internship program here: Is this a business or a nonprofit? ClassWish is a nonprofit, but we use the latest techniques from the business world to make a leveraged, scalable and financially-self sustaining difference in the lives of tens of millions of children. This sounds ambitious! Daniel Burnham, the great Chicago architect, said \\\"Make no little plans; they have not the power to stir men&rsquo;s souls.\\\" (Nor women&rsquo;s, we hasten to add). Little plans also do not have the power to provide a better education to 56 million kids who deserve more than they are getting today. We face a crushing need in schools, have a solid plan to address it, and with your help, we intend to grow this very large and very fast. Where are you located? We are in Manhattan, conveniently located right across from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. Four express subway stops, LIRR, and the PATH train are all within one block. We also hire interns to work remotely from other cities. What skills and experience are you looking for? We seek a wide range of skills: graphic designers, videographers, writers, researchers, creative thinkers, analytical sorts, community organizers, social media stars, people with great communication skills, MBA students, and more. I looked at your site and have some suggestions. Great! This is a collaborative project, and we want to hear from you. Your ClassWish review will be helpful. Is this a paid internship? We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your rsum, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions. Do check to see if your school offers a stipend program. When will you select the interns? We&rsquo;re agile. When we see a great candidate, we extend an invitation immediately.

FAQ - Review ClassWish.org&rsquo;s outstanding internship program here: Is this a business or a nonprofit? We are a nonprofit, but we use the latest techniques from the business world to make a leveraged, scalable and financially-self sustaining difference in the lives of tens of millions of schoolchildren.

We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your rsum, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions.

Our Approach: ClassWish.org, an exciting new nonprofit, uses modern business practices and the latest marketing techniques to help 125,000 schools serving 56 million kids, inform, inspire and engage supporters.

A pioneering nonprofit, Heifer International, has shown that nonprofits can capture some of that money by making donations, given in a friend&rsquo;s name, feel like a present. It works! They raise $115 million a year this way. Imagine how much more gift money could be captured by nonprofits addressing popular causes, including your favorites. The challenge is that it is too daunting for most nonprofits to provide a gift-like experience: tangible donation opportunities, wish lists, gift registries, and personalized printed greeting cards. About www.ChangingThePresent.org Our nonprofit site provides a gift-like experience, which helps 400 leading nonprofits capture money normally spent on traditional presents. The NY Times called it an \\\"amazon.com of the nonprofit world.\\\" We are now about to invite all million nonprofits to join the site. We are also providing each with their own private, charitable gift sites so they can send supporters without exposing them to other nonprofits. See a sample: http://SampleNGO.GiftsForHumanity.org. We facilitate this type of giving for individuals and nonprofits, and we promote this as a social norm. The Office Environment This is a great place to work. We have interns and volunteers from all over the United States and all around the world. The atmosphere is energetic, creative, and fun. We value brainstorming, initiative, sharing, and collaborating. Think of it is a laboratory, studio, seminar, or incubator. We are also casual.

The primary role of a Bronx Health Corps volunteer is to educate Bronx older adults on one of the following health topics: Asthma Management Healthy Diet, Exercise, and Stress Management Living with Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease and Related Dementias Healthy Heart Diabetes Management Volunteers will select one of the above topics and then receive training on the selected topic. This training will equip the volunteers to provide education sessions for older adults at a Bronx-based senior center or community site. The material will be engaging, interactive and fun! Prior knowledge of these topics is not required. Training for the volunteers is slated to start in the Spring of 2017. The educational workshops will be carried out over 18 months in three cycles: January to May 2017, July to November 2017 and January to May 2018. Volunteers will need to be available during normal business hours (Mon-Fri 9am-4pm) The Bronx Health Corps project is a unique opportunity to help improve the health outcomes of Bronx older adults. Unfortunately, Bronx County is ranked last among all 62 counties in terms of population health. You can make a positive, perhaps even life-altering, impact in the lives of the Bronx&rsquo;s older adults, by volunteering. Please take the first step and obtain an application via email.
