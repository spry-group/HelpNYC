Parents with the dominant form of PKD have a 50% chance of passing the disease on to each of their children. For the recessive form, ARPKD, parents have usually never heard of PKD until their newborn is diagnosed with it. For 30% of newborns, ARPKD is fatal.

Heavyweight: the average amount of food rescued from this event is enough for a group of around five or so people. WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW: Please be aware volunteers should be able to carry a bag of food for a 15 to 30 minute walk. This event happens rain or shine. WHERE TO MEET: Please meet inside the Two Forks restaurant RESCUING LEFTOVER CUISINE: Rescuing Leftover Cuisine is a national 501(c)3 non-profit food rescue organization, operating in 16 cities and headquartered in New York City, that provides solutions to prevent excess wholesome cuisine from being wasted. RLC provides services such as food waste consulting, excess food delivery, co-branding services, and tax credit assistance. RLC approaches the two large issues of hunger and food waste in three main ways. First, we localize the issues into sets of communities that can help sustain themselves. We crowdsource the solution of the transportation to the members of the public in these communities as volunteers. After identifying the homeless shelters of a needy community, we proactively find restaurants, hotels, and catering companies with excess food in that vicinity that could help support these disadvantaged communities. Second, we leverage technology to facilitate the identification and handling of excess food. Thus, partner food providers report when excess food is occurring and a web application is used to engage community members, because volunteering with us can be as easy as taking a brisk walk. Third, we tackle food waste at its root, aiming to eliminate as much food waste as possible and bringing the remaining excess food to where it is needed most. The data of when food waste occurs is used in our analysis of what types of food waste could be avoided, and RLC suggests ways that partner food providers can reduce waste at its root.", "title": "Rescuing Leftover Cuisine with One Brick in Midtown Manhattan", "zipcode": "10018", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D3172665%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "ONE BRICK"}, {"end": "2019-09-14", "description": "For a Day Foundation is hosting a brunch benefit in midtown Manhattan, to raise money for its national programs for kids with cancer.

Details on the Performance: How has the climate changed in the past? How is it changing now? How do we know? And what kind of a future do we want to create? Described as \\\"Theatre that can change the world,\\\" this play addresses climate change through riveting personal and scientific accounts. Chris Rapley and Duncan Macmillan (1984) bring to life the horrors of CO2 emissions and what will happen to future generations if we do not act responsibly with regards to our planet. Originally performed at the Royal Court in London in 2014 and now making its debut in the United States. A portion of proceeds from this play will be donated to 350.org, an organization dedicated to reversing climate change. This Production will be put on along with Episcopal Actor's Guild Open Stage Grant. All proceeds will be split between Ripple Effect Artists and the charitable programs of the Episcopal Actors' Guild (EAG). EAG (est. 1923) is a charitable organization dedicated to helping NYC's professional performing artists \\\"of all faiths, and none\\\" who are experiencing financial crisis.

RIPPLE EFFECT: \\\"Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.\\\" -Robert F.

Committed to working with productions and touring companies that promoted a sense of change through dialogue, Jessie sought to change her community and the world by developing an organization that melded her two loves, theatre and crucial conversations. After years of working in Educational Theatre, as a public speaker, actress, author, graduate student, and her work with Landmark Education and United Global Shift, she has developed an even stronger commitment to making a difference through her love of theatre and appreciation for theatre-education as a vehicle. Thus Ripple Effect Artists was conceived.

The Guggenheim realizes this mission through exceptional exhibitions, education programs, research initiatives, and publications.
