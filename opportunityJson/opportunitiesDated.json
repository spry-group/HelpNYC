Morning interns provide support in an academic classroom setting for math and literacy. Afternoon interns provide support in a particular enrichment activity, such as: art, theater, ballet, hip-hop, capoeira, yoga, and more.

A strong social justice-centered curriculum and required readings will form the core framework for the internship. At the end of the summer, interns will have completed a portfolio with work from daily classroom and professional development sessions, co-led a professional development session, gained leadership skills, and developed a culminating Hustle project that they will showcase for other GO Project interns, staff members, board members, and community supporters.
