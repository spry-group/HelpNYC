Here is an opportunity to help underprivileged children, to help under-served children, to help the more than 55 million children displaced from school due to COVID-19, and even to help many adults who can't read. Here is an opportunity to help close the social inequality gap, by closing the opportunity gap, by closing the education gap, by closing the literacy gap, and by creating a new era of near-100% literacy for the next generation of emerging American school children. We are looking for six, very special people, who have the skills, expertise, experience, passion, and time to be part of something amazing that is about to fundamentally change the lives of millions of children. Right now, millions of children have no hope; but soon, they will have the opportunity to learn how to read, which, in turn, will open a window to education and to a world of potential for them that, not only, has never been opened before, but that has never even been seriously contemplated as a potential reality. What we are talking about is adaptive learning, gamified smartphone app, called FUNetix, that can literally, teach a child how to read, in their own home, in an average of just 12 hours of total use time! We are the American Youth Literacy Foundation, and we have been teaching children how to read for nearly 12 years! We have been developing this app for about two years, and this year we will launch this incredible smartphone app in the App Store and on Google Play by Thanksgiving, 2020, to help save millions of children from a lifetime of illiteracy! Already, there are millions of children who are struggling to learn how to read. Already, there are millions more who have given up on reading and are destined to go through life either completely illiterate, or with semi-literate skills at best. And now with the displacement of tens of millions of children from school, for an indeterminate amount of time , the loss of reading capacity of the next generation presents a new, watershed moment in American education; this can either be a crisis, and a very real threat to the future success of millions of young students, or it can become an opportunity to change the American education landscape forever , by bringing literacy to millions of children who would otherwise have continued down the same path of scarcity and deprivation as so many generations before them. So many people are asking for \\\"Real Solutions\\\" now, not just talk, or continued, seemingly never-ending \\\"conversations\\\" about social reform. At the American Youth Literacy Foundation, we believe that literacy itself, second only to family and faith, is the single most \\\"upstream\\\" component parts of that \\\"Real Solution;\\\" and that literacy is the underpinning of all education; and that education is the key to every individual's opportunity for self-actualization, and the only truly scaleable, truly proven \\\"ticket\\\" out of the oppressive burden of poverty. We are partnered with an engineering team that was one of the five, $1 million finalists, in the XPrize for Global Learning competition (the winners of which were announced last May), which was a worldwide competition for app \\\"design and development\\\" teams to design, build and deliver a tablet-based app to children in remote villages in Africa which could teach them how to read and do basic math (children of all ages, most of whom had never been to school before in their lives). The Xprize competition was incredibly successful at bringing awareness and attention to the use of technology as a potential equalizer in the world of education. The curriculum that our app is based on is a patented reading decoding system , and is so effective at teaching children how to read, that it usually only takes 4-6 hours for them to understand the basic learning tools, and another 4-6 hours for them to reach a 2nd grade reading level. Compare this to so many of our students who have been in the public school system for 6 years and still can't spell simple words like \\\"the, said, was, would, could, there or through.\\\" Compare this to millions of students who have dropped out of school, primarily because they can't read ( more than 10 million per decade (24% according to U.S. Government statistics)). More than 20 million children in grades 3-12 in America's public schools today are either completely or functionally illiterate, according to the U.S. Government&rsquo;s \\\"Annual Report Card.\\\" Our organization is a 12-year-old, nationwide, charitable 501 c 3 non-profits founded in 2008. We started out as a regional tutoring program, then became a nationwide tutoring program; but all the while, our focus has always been on finding a scalable solution to the literacy crisis in America. With the rise of the smartphone and the amazing penetration of this powerful tool (more than 80% in even the most impoverished communities), we feel that the answer we have been searching for IS in the form of an app. So for the past several years, we have been working to convert our amazing reading curriculum that teaches children how to read in 12 hours, into an app that teaches children how to read in 12 hours. And this is where you come in. We have more than 50 people working to build, test, and deliver this app to millions of children in America's inner cities and rural communities, to the barrios and the suburbs and the American Indian reservations and everywhere in-between. But in order to do this, we need to reach the people who need it the most. And in order to reach those people and those communities, we need to hear from you, and people like you who live in those communities. We need to better understand the current state of the schools and the education system at the local level in your neighborhood, town or city. We need to more fully understand the specific challenges that illiteracy and low literacy have burdened your community with, so that we can more fully develop a workable tactical plan to reverse the literacy crisis and lift those burdens, using the FUNetix Reading App. The FUNetix curriculum is approximately 12 hours and 2,000 screens that take a child from the ABC's to a 2nd-grade reading level. Children learn the fundamentals of letters and sounds and how to blend sound symbols together to form words and sentences. The app uses a super-child-friendly, phonetic code called 21E, that makes it easy to learn how to read. The FUNetix Reading System is patented and uses a special diacritic decoding system to show children the irregular spelling patterns of English, and especially how to pronounce any English word. At the American Youth Literacy Foundation, our goal is to bring the FUNetix Reading App to children who are not learning how to read in school, either because they are in schools that are failing, or because they are in difficult situations at home for a variety of reasons. Many parents are desperate for an education solution for their children, but the challenge of teaching reading to children is too great for teachers with classes of up to 40 children or more, combined with a typical \\\"off the shelf\\\" reading curriculum that is confusing and doesn&rsquo;t scale. Children get lost, confused, frustrated and bored; and many of them act out, forcing teachers to focus on classroom management as opposed to classroom learning. The REAL literacy rates in so many thousands of America&rsquo;s elementary schools are 20% or less in 3rd grade and beyond! But it doesn't have to be that way; and FUNetix is going to change ALL of this, soon! The role of a Community Liaison is as a connector. You will help Youth Lit connect to your community and many hundreds of other communities across the United States by reaching out to understand exactly how the literacy crisis is affecting people in those communities, and by finding out what specific solutions they desire, and how best we can bring our literacy app into the homes and minds of the children who need it most. A Community Liaison is someone who is passionate about ending the literacy crisis in America, and finally creating that \\\"Equal Playing Field\\\" that everyone has been talking about for so long. But a Community Liaison also brings key ideas and action steps that they believe can be taken in order to make that happen. Such steps may involve working with specific people in the community, advertising at select locations, connecting with specific organizations, or otherwise finding ways to reach the parents and children that are most in need of a new solution to reading and education. Working together, we will radically, positively impact communities all across the United States, by bringing \\\"Literacy for All\\\" to the next generation of emerging learners. We are looking for six intelligent, creative, outgoing, enthusiastic, cheerful, optimistic individuals with significant real-world experience and a willingness to both talk to and listen to people, and to identify ways to best share the benefits of our app with those children in need. This is a complex undertaking and we are looking for highly proficient and organized professional-minded individuals who have a track record of success in creating positive outcomes in their communities, and who are willing to reach beyond, to other communities like their own, to bring change across America. The specific action step that we need you to take now is to complete a google form that will be sent to you if you express interest in this position by hitting the \\\"I'm interested\\\" button. Just to be clear, our organization is an all-volunteer, mission-centric, extended virtual network, comprised of highly skilled and experienced individuals from around the country (and a few from around the world) who collaborate through cloud-based technology and platforms. Individuals interested in this position must have the confidence and ability to work in a virtual environment (as well as on the street and on the ground) using select networking and communications tools and platforms. Given the current \\\"social distancing\\\" environment that we find ourselves in, individuals must also be willing to pick up the phone, send out emails, schedule Zoom meetings and use other communications technologies to contact and build relationships within our target audience. Thank you! We hope we have given you enough information about who we are and what our mission and goals are; and we hope that this opportunity finds you at the right place and the right time in your career to make a difference and an impact, in an amazing way, for millions of children who are waiting for someone, or something, to lead them out of a life of impoverishment and into a future of unlimited possibility and potential.

And this is where you come in. The App is comprised of approximately 2,000 unique screens, each of which is fully narrated. After the child learns the fundamentals of letters and sounds and how to blend sound symbols to form words and sentences (using a super-child-friendly, phonetic code called 21E), we transition them to English, where we utilize our patented diacritic decoding system to introduce them to the irregular letter patterns found in English spelling. From there, we continue to increase students' awareness of the various letter patterns and combinations, while simultaneously introducing them to more and more complex sentences, stories and interactive, fiction and non-fiction content. As students progress in their reading capability, we begin to introduce primers, books, stories, games, puzzles and other content that will be embedded within the learning modules AND that children will have access to in our \\\"Wonderful Content Library\\\" that is unlocked after they have finished the 12-hour structured curriculum. There's much more to tell. You can read more about our story and about us on our website at www.FUNetix.org and at www.YouthLit.org .

When you reply you will receive an auto-reply email containing an attached pdf. Follow the instructions on the pdf to illustrate ONLY ONE of the two story samples.

Have you ever wanted to do something AMAZING to change the world but didn't know where to start? Here is an opportunity to help underprivileged children, to help under-served children, to help ALL children displaced from school due to COVID-19, and even to help many adults who can't read. We are looking for three, very special people, who have the skills, expertise, experience, passion, and time to be part of something amazing that is about to fundamentally change the lives of millions of children. Right now, millions of children have no hope; but soon, they will have the opportunity to learn how to read, which, in turn, will open a window to education and to a world of potential for them that, not only, has never been opened before, but that has never even been seriously contemplated as a potential reality. What we are talking about is an adaptive learning, gamified smartphone app, called FUNetix, that can literally, teach a child how to read, in the comfort of their home, in an average of just 12 hours of total use time! We are the American Youth Literacy Foundation, and we have been teaching children how to read for nearly 12 years! We have been developing this app for about two years, and this year we will launch this incredible smartphone app in the App Store and on Google Play by Thanksgiving, 2020, to help save millions of children from a lifetime of illiteracy! Already, there are millions of children who are struggling to learn how to read. Already, there are millions more who have given up on reading and are destined to go through life either completely illiterate, or with semi-literate skills at best. And now with the displacement of tens of millions of children from school, for an indeterminate amount of time , the loss of reading capacity of the next generation presents a new, crisis moment in American education \u00c2 and a very real threat to the future success of millions of young students. We are partnered with an engineering team that was one of the five $1 million finalists in the XPrize for Global Learning competition (the winners of which were announced this past May), which was a worldwide competition for app \\\"design and development\\\" teams from around the world to design, build and deliver a tablet-based app to children in remote villages in Africa which could teach them how to read and do basic math (children of all ages, most of whom had never been to school before in their lives). The curriculum that our app is based on is a patented reading decoding system, and is so effective at teaching children how to read, that it usually only takes 4-6 hours for them to understand the basic learning tools, and another 4-6 hours for them to reach a 2nd grade reading level. Compare this to so many of our students who have been in the public school system for 6 years and still can't spell the word \\\"the.\\\" Compare this to millions of students who have dropped out of school, primarily because they can't read (more than 10 million per decade). More than 20 million children in grades 3-12 in America's public schools today can't read! Our organization is an 11 year old, nationwide, charitable 501 c 3 non-profit. We started out as a tutoring program and we still provide one-on-one tutoring. But our focus has always been on finding a scalable solution to the literacy crisis in America. With the rise of the smartphone and the amazing penetration of this powerful tool (currently estimated at 80%), even into the most impoverished communities, we feel that the answer we have been searching for IS in the form of an app. So for the past several years we have been working to convert our amazing reading curriculum, that teaches children how to read in an average of just 12 hours, into an app that teaches children how to read in about the same time. And this is where you come in. The App is comprised of approximately 2,000 unique screens, each of which is fully narrated. After the child learns the fundamentals of letters and sounds and how to blend sound symbols to form words and sentences (using a super-child-friendly, phonetic code called 21E), we transition them to English, where we utilize our patented diacritic decoding system to introduce them to the irregular letter patterns found in English spelling. From there, we continue to increase students' awareness of the various letter patterns and combinations, while simultaneously introducing them to more and more complex sentences, stories and interactive, fiction and non-fiction content. As students progress in their reading capability, we begin to introduce primers, books, stories, games, puzzles and other content that will be embedded within the learning modules AND that children will have access to in our \\\"Wonderful Content Library\\\" that is unlocked after they have finished the 12-hour structured curriculum. There's much more to tell. You can read more about our story and about us on our website at www.FUNetix.org and at www.YouthLit.org . We are looking for some very special people who have the passion, time, and especially, the illustration skills needed to help us populate our proprietary reading materials child-friendly, colorful, happy, creative and otherwise wonderful drawings that potentially millions of children will see on their path to learning how to read. If you wish to be considered for this opportunity to be one of volunteer children&rsquo;s book illustrators, please send us a sample of your artwork by replying to this listing. When you reply you will receive an auto-reply email containing an attached pdf. Follow the instructions on the pdf to illustrate ONLY ONE of the two story samples. (Each sample contains 2 screens, so you will be illustrating 2 screens from the same story.) Send your samples to info@FUNetix.org and we will respond to you if we choose your illustration. EVEN IF we don&rsquo;t choose you to illustrate one of the sample stories, we may still contact you to illustrate one of our many other stories or books. We are looking for intelligent, creative, enthusiastic, cheerful, optimistic individuals who can present a \\\"look and feel\\\" to children ages 5-9 that is happy, not scary; uplifting, not sad; bright and colorful, not dark or ominous; cute or whimsical, or otherwise conveying a positive outlook on the world. Thank you! We hope this opportunity finds you at the right place and the right time to make a difference and an impact, in an amazing way, for millions of children who are waiting for someone, or something, to lead them out of a life of impoverishment and into a future of unlimited possibility and potential through literacy.
