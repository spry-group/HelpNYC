{"07101": [{"end": "2019-06-09", "description": "Captain Responsibilities We want you - as our captain - to take ownership in your local Five Fifty Fifty Run/Walk event. Put your passion for mental health issues to work by gathering support for the run/walk in your community. This includes attracting participants, donations, sponsors and volunteers. And know we are here to support you every step of the way! Finding Participants: Below are some suggested ways to draw more participants to your local Five Fifty Fifty Run/Walk event. Keep in mind we will be doing social media advertising, email blasts and press releases in each market. \uf0b7 Distribute flyers and post cards (we will provide the materials) \uf0b7 Speak to civic groups, school groups and other organizations with a focus on mental health \uf0b7 Use social media to spread the word \uf0b7 Visit local running stores and running clubs to talk up the event (make sure to take flyers with you!) \uf0b7 Encourage groups of any kind to participate. They can create a team through our online registration system and members can sign up for the team during the registration process. Finding Donations: Funds raised from run/walk registrations are crucial, but account for less than half of our revenue. Donations are another important source of funding in our mission. Here are some suggestions for raising money for the Five Fifty Fifty cause: \uf0b7 Encourage participants to make a donation during the registration process. The registration site gives them the option of doing this. \uf0b7 Encourage participants to set up their own fundraising page and solicit donations that way. \uf0b7 Ask participating groups to set a fundraising goal and help them achieve it by offering prizes such as gift cards and apparel. Finding Sponsors: The final piece of our funding puzzle is through corporate sponsorships. We have found there are many businesses and organizations who share our passion for mental health issues. It&rsquo;s just a matter of finding them. You can reach out to local businesses and organizations for sponsorship. They can sponsor our local event or even become a regional or national sponsor. There are different sponsorship levels at the local/state, regional and national levels. We will send you an electronic version of our sponsor sheet. You are encouraged to email this document to any potential sponsors, or print and hand-deliver it if you are meeting in person. If you would like to bring in a Five Fifty Fifty staff member for assistance in the process, we are happy to help. In addition to cash sponsorships, we are looking for in-kind sponsors to help offset costs for things like food and drinks at the events, advertising and printing. Finding Volunteers: We will need anywhere from 5 to 15 volunteers, depending on the location, at each Five Fifty Fifty Run/Walk event. We will provide you with a list of positions needed about one month prior to the event. When you are out in the community promoting the run/walk to groups and individuals, keep in mind the need for volunteers and take down information if someone asks how they can help. One of your duties in the weeks leading up to the race will be coordinating the volunteers and making sure there are enough people to fill the spots. Your Role on Event Day: As a captain, we ask that you take a leadership role on the day of the run/walk. You are welcome to participate as a runner or walker, but we also expect you to assist our staff in setting up the event site, coordinating volunteers and answering questions from participants. We will have a 2-3 person staff onsite for the event. They will oversee course setup and teardown. Questions?

Put your passion for mental health issues to work by gathering support for the run/walk in your community. This includes attracting participants, donations, sponsors and volunteers. And know we are here to support you every step of the way! Finding Participants: Below are some suggested ways to draw more participants to your local Five Fifty Fifty Run/Walk event. Keep in mind we will be doing social media advertising, email blasts and press releases in each market. \uf0b7 Distribute flyers and post cards (we will provide the materials) \uf0b7 Speak to civic groups, school groups and other organizations with a focus on mental health \uf0b7 Use social media to spread the word \uf0b7 Visit local running stores and running clubs to talk up the event (make sure to take flyers with you!) \uf0b7 Encourage groups of any kind to participate. They can create a team through our online registration system and members can sign up for the team during the registration process. Finding Donations: Funds raised from run/walk registrations are crucial, but account for less than half of our revenue. Donations are another important source of funding in our mission. Here are some suggestions for raising money for the Five Fifty Fifty cause: \uf0b7 Encourage participants to make a donation during the registration process. The registration site gives them the option of doing this. \uf0b7 Encourage participants to set up their own fundraising page and solicit donations that way. \uf0b7 Ask participating groups to set a fundraising goal and help them achieve it by offering prizes such as gift cards and apparel. Finding Sponsors: The final piece of our funding puzzle is through corporate sponsorships. We have found there are many businesses and organizations who share our passion for mental health issues. It&rsquo;s just a matter of finding them. You can reach out to local businesses and organizations for sponsorship. They can sponsor our local event or even become a regional or national sponsor. There are different sponsorship levels at the local/state, regional and national levels. We will send you an electronic version of our sponsor sheet. You are encouraged to email this document to any potential sponsors, or print and hand-deliver it if you are meeting in person. If you would like to bring in a Five Fifty Fifty staff member for assistance in the process, we are happy to help. In addition to cash sponsorships, we are looking for in-kind sponsors to help offset costs for things like food and drinks at the events, advertising and printing. Finding Volunteers: We will need anywhere from 5 to 15 volunteers, depending on the location, at each Five Fifty Fifty Run/Walk event. We will provide you with a list of positions needed about one month prior to the event. When you are out in the community promoting the run/walk to groups and individuals, keep in mind the need for volunteers and take down information if someone asks how they can help. One of your duties in the weeks leading up to the race will be coordinating the volunteers and making sure there are enough people to fill the spots. Your Role on Event Day: As a captain, we ask that you take a leadership role on the day of the run/walk. You are welcome to participate as a runner or walker, but we also expect you to assist our staff in setting up the event site, coordinating volunteers and answering questions from participants. We will have a 2-3 person staff onsite for the event. They will oversee course setup and teardown. Questions?

(Course likely will have 100+ students.) Classes meet twice a week, but tutors only need to attend one of those days weekly. Much of the tutoring support will be done virtually. Tutors will coordinate with each other, and work closely with the instructor. Tutors will be supported through the process by the City Tutors staff. We will support the Monday and Wednesday course from 2 - 3:15 pm. Let us know which course date works for you. Our course support will be determined based on tutor time availability. This is a great opportunity especially for students who are majoring (or have already earned a degree) in sociology, or who are social science majors/minors. All majors are welcome to apply. Tutors will get to enhance their understanding of writing composition and gain professional experience and references that they can leverage for future opportunities. As a tutor, you would identify students struggling, provide feedback to the instructor regarding students' concerns and difficulties that can lead to changes in future lessons, conduct virtual study groups, and allow students to submit parts of their writing for review before final drafts are submitted. All tutors are also expected to complete a four session comprehensive, professional training regimen over the course of the semester. 6 hours of live training, plus another hour and a half for orientation. This is a commitment of 7.5 hours of in person training, and 4 hours of supplemental training for a total of 11.5 hours of training over the course of the Spring semester. Training days will be determined based on your schedule and that of the Tutor Training Coordinators. CT's embedded tutoring program has been successful in helping students gain access to support that they otherwise would not have received, given their limited time spent on campus. Having a tutor in the class early in the semester will allow us to employ strategies to reduce withdrawals and student failure rates. Your work with us would help the students&rsquo; overall subject area performance, and help us improve this educational support model, reaching more students and departments with comprehensive academic support. To apply, you must: Have received an A- or A in the introduction to the subject course you are applying to tutor Have a GPA at or above 3.2, or have completed a degree program Submit monthly reports, keep a log sheet of any tutoring appointments done outside of class, and regularly communicate with the tutor training coordinator.

This can serve 58,064,516,129 meals using the national average amount spent on a meal, $2.79. In order to address this issue of waster, Rescuing Leftover Cuisine helps bring food from our partners to a local homeless shelter. It takes less than an hour and you can set your own schedule, whether you want to help out daily, weekly, or sporadically. Our events at Rescuing Leftover Cuisine typically last 30 minutes (Some events are longer, some are shorter). On each event, we rescue an average of 50 pounds of food, which feeds about 40 people. It only take 30 minutes to help feed over 40 people! WHAT WE'LL BE DOING: Help rescue some prepared food and drinks from a restaurant in Chelsea! Heavyweight: the average amount of food rescued from this event is enough for a group of around five or so people. WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW: Please be aware volunteers should be able to carry a bag of food for a 15 to 30 minute walk. This event happens rain or shine! WHERE TO MEET: Restaurant is in Chelsea.

RESCUING LEFTOVER CUISINE: Rescuing Leftover Cuisine is a national 501(c)3 non-profit food rescue organization, operating in 16 cities and headquartered in New York City, that provides solutions to prevent excess wholesome cuisine from being wasted. RLC provides services such as food waste consulting, excess food delivery, co-branding services, and tax credit assistance. RLC approaches the two large issues of hunger and food waste in three main ways. First, we localize the issues into sets of communities that can help sustain themselves. We crowdsource the solution of the transportation to the members of the public in these communities as volunteers. After identifying the homeless shelters of a needy community, we proactively find restaurants, hotels, and catering companies with excess food in that vicinity that could help support these disadvantaged communities. Second, we leverage technology to facilitate the identification and handling of excess food. Thus, partner food providers report when excess food is occurring and a web application is used to engage community members, because volunteering with us can be as easy as taking a brisk walk. Third, we tackle food waste at its root, aiming to eliminate as much food waste as possible and bringing the remaining excess food to where it is needed most. The data of when food waste occurs is used in our analysis of what types of food waste could be avoided, and RLC suggests ways that partner food providers can reduce waste at its root.", "title": "Volunteer with One Brick and Rescuing Leftover Cuisine", "zipcode": "10001", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D3108985%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "ONE BRICK"}, {"end": "2019-04-28", "description": "Realize Your Beauty is looking for volunteers to help out with a special event!

Put your passion for mental health issues to work by gathering support for the run/walk in your community. This includes attracting participants, donations, sponsors and volunteers. And know we are here to support you every step of the way! Finding Participants: Below are some suggested ways to draw more participants to your local Five Fifty Fifty Run/Walk event. Keep in mind we will be doing social media advertising, email blasts and press releases in each market. \uf0b7 Distribute flyers and post cards (we will provide the materials) \uf0b7 Speak to civic groups, school groups and other organizations with a focus on mental health \uf0b7 Use social media to spread the word \uf0b7 Visit local running stores and running clubs to talk up the event (make sure to take flyers with you!) \uf0b7 Encourage groups of any kind to participate. They can create a team through our online registration system and members can sign up for the team during the registration process. Finding Donations: Funds raised from run/walk registrations are crucial, but account for less than half of our revenue. Donations are another important source of funding in our mission. Here are some suggestions for raising money for the Five Fifty Fifty cause: \uf0b7 Encourage participants to make a donation during the registration process. The registration site gives them the option of doing this. \uf0b7 Encourage participants to set up their own fundraising page and solicit donations that way. \uf0b7 Ask participating groups to set a fundraising goal and help them achieve it by offering prizes such as gift cards and apparel. Finding Sponsors: The final piece of our funding puzzle is through corporate sponsorships. We have found there are many businesses and organizations who share our passion for mental health issues. It&rsquo;s just a matter of finding them. You can reach out to local businesses and organizations for sponsorship. They can sponsor our local event or even become a regional or national sponsor. There are different sponsorship levels at the local/state, regional and national levels. We will send you an electronic version of our sponsor sheet. You are encouraged to email this document to any potential sponsors, or print and hand-deliver it if you are meeting in person. If you would like to bring in a Five Fifty Fifty staff member for assistance in the process, we are happy to help. In addition to cash sponsorships, we are looking for in-kind sponsors to help offset costs for things like food and drinks at the events, advertising and printing. Finding Volunteers: We will need anywhere from 5 to 15 volunteers, depending on the location, at each Five Fifty Fifty Run/Walk event. We will provide you with a list of positions needed about one month prior to the event. When you are out in the community promoting the run/walk to groups and individuals, keep in mind the need for volunteers and take down information if someone asks how they can help. One of your duties in the weeks leading up to the race will be coordinating the volunteers and making sure there are enough people to fill the spots. Your Role on Event Day: As a captain, we ask that you take a leadership role on the day of the run/walk. You are welcome to participate as a runner or walker, but we also expect you to assist our staff in setting up the event site, coordinating volunteers and answering questions from participants. We will have a 2-3 person staff onsite for the event. They will oversee course setup and teardown. Questions?

There is no early medical detection or cure for Autism. Autism receives less than 5% the research of many less prevalent childhood diseases. Autism costs a family about $60,000 a year. The financial impact of an Autism diagnosis Today&rsquo;s economy is rough on families around the country, but there are some who are impacted more than others. Having a child with autism is an emotional, physical, and fiscal feat. The loss of one parent&rsquo;s income: Autistic children require around-the-clock care which is typically taken on by one parent while the other shoulders the burden of making a living to support the family. Specialty schooling, activities and equipment: Government operated schools offer basic FDA approved methods that are ineffective beyond their limited scope, forcing parents to invest in specialty schools, activities, and tutors which can cost several hundred dollars per month-or thousands per year. Lacking health coverage: Insurance plans exclude treatment for autism or outright refuse to cover therapies related to behavior/sensory issues because they are considered \\\"educational\\\" rather than medical, leaving parents to pay these exorbitant costs out-of-pocket. Why support AAF? At AAF our goals as AWARENESS - EDUCATION - TREATMENT - RESEARCH - SUPPORT Our Workshops and Seminars -We identify emerging/cutting-edge treatments and therapies in the field of Autism and invite leading practitioners from all over to conduct workshops at a subsidized cost in a central location that caters to a large network of families. Furthermore we provide grants to those families that require additional financial assistance to participate in our programs. Our Efforts Overseas - We collaborate with organizations in developing countries (with much less access to the latest therapies and treatments) and sponsor workshops, clinics and programs such as \\\"Treat-A-Child\\\" (in India) to spread awareness on the latest innovations and techniques in the field of autism. Biomedical Initiatives -Consultation, evaluation, treatment plan and referral services by a registered nurse and physician at AAF clinics at a subsidized cost. Research Grants -Our collaboration with Rutgers University Social Skills Programs - Care For A Friend is our social skills program geared towards social acceptance of autistic children amongst their \\\"typical\\\" peers.
