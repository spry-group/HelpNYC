Blue Engine recruits, trains, and matches a team of three BETAs with a teacher in ELA or algebra in 8th, 9th, or 10th grades (where Blue Engine currently focuses). More adults in the classroom reduces the teacher to student ratio from about 30:1 to 6:1 enabling teachers to build authentic relationships with students, provides significantly more instructional hours during class and before/after school, and differentiates, individualizes, and personalizes instruction. The teacher-BETA collaboration enables daily student-centered reflection and learning that improves teacher practice. No student goes unseen or heard. At the same time, Blue Engine's hybrid model helps a diverse, local wave of educators enter the teaching profession through an apprenticeship (as a BETA and AmeriCorps member), teaching alongside a team for one or two years with the opportunity to earn their teaching credential in their second year through Relay Graduate School of Education. Blue Engine is more than an \\\"equal opportunity employer.\\\" We acknowledge the roles we play as educators and leaders in the very tangible systems of oppression and racism that exist in our communities and classrooms and strive to be an actively anti-racist organization. We believe that by assembling diverse and inclusive teams, we can build alliances that fundamentally disrupt and dismantle these systems at their root. Desired Skills Is curious about an apprenticeship model to implement a team teaching approach within public middle and high school classrooms Is motivated by building relationships and working on a team Is interested in collaborating with others and learning & developing through feedback Is flexible and can adapt to the often fast paced and changing school environment Qualifications Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree. You must have received your bachelor&rsquo;s degree from an accredited college or university by the first day of Blue Engine&rsquo;s summer training institute in August. 2.50 Minimum GPA (undergrad). You must have a cumulative 2.50 GPA on a 4.00 scale from an accredited college or university upon graduation. US Citizenship or National / Permanent Resident Status. BETAs must be cleared through background and security checks prior to beginning their year of service. Interest in being a teacher and prior education or AmeriCorps experience is not required to become a BETA. Responsibilities BETAs devote 1-2 years of service (as AmeriCorps members) in partnership with certified Department of Education teachers in critical gateway skills; high school Algebra and English Language Arts. BETAs complete four weeks of training in August and receive consistent support throughout the school year. While they are not the lead teacher in the classroom, BETAs are responsible for many of the same things, including attending meetings, preparing for lessons, tutoring, grading, attending school events, and making parent phone calls. Upon completing the year of service, BETAs have the option to stay for a second year as a Team Coordinator, where they manage a team of BETAs, and can choose to enroll in Blue Engine&rsquo;s teacher residency program at Relay Graduate School of Education to become a certified, full-time teacher.

Through guided lessons and activities, students will learn about well-known foods such as sushi, which many already recognize as Japanese, as well as other home-style dishes such as miso soup and onigiri (riceballs) which can be easily prepared. Through these interactive programs, we hope to instill a deeper understanding of Japanese food and culture while equipping them with lifelong practical knowledge and skills about one of the world&rsquo;s healthiest diets. Our Cooking Instructors and Volunteers will implement and teach the Wa-Shokuiku Curriculum in schools across New York City, Washington D.C., and Boston.

Curriculum is provided by the Wa-Shokuiku Project. Supervise children participants, ensuring proper hygiene, meal creation, and clean up. Facilitate class discussions of concepts of Japanese cuisine and food education, allowing participants to brainstorm how they might put new knowledge and food education concepts into action, discuss barriers to adopting new concepts, and share ideas with their peers. Coordinate with other key Wa-Shokuiku staff to gather information, data, and resources on the success of our programs to identify areas of improvement. Skills/Experience Required: Interest and comfort in working with children from diverse backgrounds. Familiarity and knowledge of Japanese food and culture. Comfortable speaking in front of children in English. Ability to travel to class location.

Seniors and their visitor can converse and enjoy the company, take part in activities like going to cafes and museums, share stories, learn new skills, and a variety of other things based on the desires of the companions. You will be matched with a senior who has a similar personality and interests and you can decide together how to spend your time. Visits can easily fit into your schedule because matches are made based on your availability. We ask for a minimum commitment of 6 months or 1 year.

(Course likely will have 100+ students.) Classes meet twice a week, but tutors only need to attend one of those days weekly. Much of the tutoring support will be done virtually. Tutors will coordinate with each other, and work closely with the instructor. Tutors will be supported through the process by the City Tutors staff. We will either support the Mondays and Wednesdays course from 2 - 3:15 pm, or the Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9:30 - 10:45 am. Let us know which course date works for you. Our course support will be determined based on tutor time availability. This is a great opportunity especially for students who are majoring (or have already earned a degree) in sociology, or who are social science majors/minors. All majors are welcome to apply. Tutors will get to enhance their understanding of writing composition and gain professional experience and references that they can leverage for future opportunities. As a tutor, you would identify students struggling, provide feedback to the instructor regarding students' concerns and difficulties that can lead to changes in future lessons, conduct virtual study groups, and allow students to submit parts of their writing for review before final drafts are submitted. All tutors are also expected to complete a four session comprehensive, professional training regimen over the course of the semester. 6 hours of live training, plus another hour and a half for orientation. This is a commitment of 7.5 hours of in person training, and 4 hours of supplemental training for a total of 11.5 hours of training over the course of the Fall semester. Training days will be determined based on your schedule and that of the Tutor Training Coordinators. CT's embedded tutoring program has been successful in helping students gain access to support that they otherwise would not have received, given their limited time spent on campus. Having a tutor in the class early in the semester will allow us to employ strategies to reduce withdrawals and student failure rates. Your work with us would help the students&rsquo; overall subject area performance, and help us improve this educational support model, reaching more students and departments with comprehensive academic support. To apply, you must: Have received an A- or A in the introduction to the subject course you are applying to tutor Have a GPA at or above 3.2, or have completed a degree program Submit monthly reports, keep a log sheet of any tutoring appointments done outside of class, and regularly communicate with the tutor training coordinator.
