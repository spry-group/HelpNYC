NYC Free Tax Prep sites are operated by community-based organizations in partnership with the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DWCP). As Brooklyn&rsquo;s largest noncommercial tax provider, we have grown to cover most of central Brooklyn along with southern Brooklyn. This is, in large part, thanks to our volunteer tax preparers. Volunteer Tax Preparers will be tasked with completing high quality tax returns for low- and middle-income Brooklynites. Our ideal tax preparer would have a high interest and motivation for building on their tax preparation experience. They should also have a passion for helping the members of our community who need it most. Most of all, our volunteers should be able to practice patience, good customer service skills, and have a great sense of humor! This is a great opportunity to build valuable work experience, meet new friends, and help people who need it. Benefits Wide ranging benefits include learning new skills or building on valuable professional experience with active work duties. We have served as professional references for many of our volunteers. CPAs, Attorneys, and Enrolled Agents also receive Continuing Education Credits upon completion of volunteer service in this program. Build a sense of achievement for directly positively affecting your fellow Brooklynites by providing them with top quality tax service without the predatory service fees associated with retail tax providers. If that isn&rsquo;t enough for you to sign up, we&rsquo;ll also provide snacks. General Requirements All volunteers are welcome! If you don't have any tax experience, no problem! We provide training. Training All tax preparers must pass the IRS Volunteer Basic Certification via the Link and Learn training module online. Advanced Certification is also welcome.

RLC provides services such as food waste consulting, excess food delivery, co-branding services, and tax credit assistance. RLC approaches the two large issues of hunger and food waste in three main ways. First, we localize the issues into sets of communities that can help sustain themselves. We crowdsource the solution of the transportation to the members of the public in these communities as volunteers. After identifying the homeless shelters of a needy community, we proactively find restaurants, hotels, and catering companies with excess food in that vicinity that could help support these disadvantaged communities. Second, we leverage technology to facilitate the identification and handling of excess food. Thus, partner food providers report when excess food is occurring and a web application is used to engage community members, because volunteering with us can be as easy as taking a brisk walk. Third, we tackle food waste at its root, aiming to eliminate as much food waste as possible and bringing the remaining excess food to where it is needed most. The data of when food waste occurs is used in our analysis of what types of food waste could be avoided, and RLC suggests ways that partner food providers can reduce waste at its root.", "title": "Volunteer with One Brick at Rescuing Leftover Cuisine - Monday - Dec 9", "zipcode": "10036", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D3233401%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "ONE BRICK"}, {"end": "2019-12-24", "description": "Dec,24th -3:30 pm to 6:00 pm- Set-up Tables and pack gift Bags.", "title": "Preparation for Project FIND Annual Christmas Dinner and Community Celebration", "zipcode": "10036", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D3049213%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "Project FIND"}, {"end": "2019-12-25", "description": "Dinner will be served to seniors on site and meals will be delivered to homebound seniors.

In order to address this issue of waster, Rescuing Leftover Cuisine helps bring food from our partners to a local homeless shelter.

Thus, partner food providers report when excess food is occurring and a web application is used to engage community members, because volunteering with us can be as easy as taking a brisk walk. Third, we tackle food waste at its root, aiming to eliminate as much food waste as possible and bringing the remaining excess food to where it is needed most.

We provide a calendar of volunteer and social events to help people get involved, have an impact, and have fun, without the requirements of long term commitments. After each volunteer event our volunteer team invites everyone to gather at a local restaurant or coffee shop where they can get to know one another in a relaxed social setting. Additionally we host regular social events for our volunteers to connect to one another and to welcome new volunteers to our community. We provide a flexible way for you to volunteer where and when you want. For this event, One Brick will again be partnering with the Story Pirates! About the Event Story Pirates wants every kid to know that their stories are important. Do you remember the elementary school thrill of an approving teacher's remark or the electrifying rush of receiving a supportive, handwritten note on your homework? We need your help to create that feeling for thousands of kids around the world. Story Love nights provide an opportunity for you to read stories written by children from all over the world and provide supportive feedback and commentary. This way every child receives handwritten feedback on their story! Kids are not present at Story Love events, but their stories are! WHAT WE'LL BE DOING: When you come to the Story Love night, a Story Pirate will do a brief introduction, go over the process for writing thoughtful and positive comments on each story, and facilitate discussion as your group reads the funny, touching, heartwarming, and sometimes heart-wrenching stories that kids write. At the end of the evening, you will have provided young people with the affirmation they need to call themselves writers-and you'll have shared some laughs, and maybe tears, from the stories. Story Love evenings are entertaining and productive. WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW: Story Pirates has been providing arts education-and giving Story Love-since 2003. This is your chance to lend a hand to a budding writer. Who knows what future talent you may uncover or who you may encourage and inspire to keep exploring the world through writing. WHERE TO MEET: Story Pirates has a new permanent location! Just let the doorman know you are a guest of the Story Pirates and head up to the 7th floor. The Story Pirates are located in Suite 701, directly across from the elevator bank. STORY PIRATES: Story Pirates (www.storypirates.org) is a nationally respected arts and creative writing organization that celebrates the words and ideas of young people, promotes literacy as a vital part of early childhood education, and preserves the spark of youthful creativity often lost in the transition to adulthood. Story Pirates does this by going in to New York City schools and providing arts education!
