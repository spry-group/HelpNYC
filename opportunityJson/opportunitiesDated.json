College Prep Mentors are matched with 2-3 SBU high school seniors as they prepare for senior year exams and navigate the college application process. Mentors focus primarily on assisting with applications, but may be called on to provide support with SAT/ACT and Regents exam preparation. Mentors promote the importance of education and serve as positive role models in youths' lives. When: Wednesdays, 6:00-8:00pm, September - June Where: Urban Assembly School for Careers in Sports, Mott Haven HS Campus, 730 Concourse Village West, Bronx, NY 10451 Commitment: Tutors are asked to commit to one evening a week for 2 hours for the entirety of the school year (Sept-June). However, if a tutor would like to be more involved, he/she is always welcome. Qualifications: South Bronx United is looking for highly motivated, energetic volunteers who want to make a difference in the lives of South Bronx youth. Volunteers should have gone through the college application process themselves, with a preference for those who have already obtained a bachelor's degree. It's not expected that tutors will be experts on the process, but they should be willing to work hard to help students with finding answers and staying on track throughout the process. Training: A orientation and training will be held before the start of the program to provide an overview of the program and start to cover some of the ins and outs of the application process. Further training will be held throughout the year to cover specific topic areas of the application process in more depth. Benefits: In addition to helping provide the resources and support to allow underserved students to thrive in school, SBU is happy to connect with your school to see if your volunteer hours can work towards school service or academic requirements. Beyond Tutoring: The boys and girls participating in the program are also members of the South Bronx United Travel Soccer Teams. Tutors are welcome and encouraged to come out and see a game or get involved in a practice as youth are extremely passionate about the sport and its a great way to connect with the kids.", "title": "College Prep Mentor", "zipcode": "10451", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D2764570%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "South Bronx United, Inc."}], "08873": [{"end": "2020-01-29", "description": "The Stein Hospice Team staff meeting is every Wednesday morning (most weeks) and we are in need of a receptionist to answer our phones during the meeting.

Sherman Bates, Pearl&rsquo;s husband, recalled that, although she had no children of her own, \\\"Pearl considered everybody to be her child.\\\" By 1965, following group and individual contributions, the YWCA Board of Directors formally designated the Pearl Bates Scholarship Fund. Now in its fifty-second year, the Pearl Bates Scholarship Fund has helped hundreds of families access all the programs and services offered at the YWCA and has awarded over two million dollars in scholarships. Friends of the YWCA are partnering with ETS to honor Pearl Bates&rsquo; legacy, highlighting the programs and services her Scholarship Fund gives access to for community families who would otherwise be unable to afford.

On any given day, more than 350 children from Middlesex County are living in foster care. Now, more than ever, we need you. A child with a CASA is more likely to find a permanent home, spend less time in foster care, and perform better in school. Champion one of these children from your community and safeguard a child&rsquo;s well being through advocacy in the court today. What does a CASA do? A CASA is integral in helping the Court in determining the appropriate permanent plan for the child. We ensure abuse and neglect doesn&rsquo;t continue at the hand&rsquo;s of the court. A CASA forges a connection with the child/children they are matched with. They build their trust and discover what their needs are. Once a month they visit with their assigned child. Advocates examine the child's health and education records and meet with their caregivers, school, therapists and other professionals. Once they identify what the child&rsquo;s needs are, they write a report and advocate for a child&rsquo;s needs in court. Our staff and peer coordinators are with you every step of the way to support you and help you succeed. No special skills or specific backgrounds are needed. Advocates must be able to commit to 18-24 months of service.

WE NEED TUTORS RIGHT NOW THROUGH THE DATE OF THE SPECIALIZED HIGH SCHOOL TEST FOR 8TH GRADERS ABOUT TO TAKE THE TEST. Every weekend and free time you can give, let us know. We will assign you a child and you must be dedicated to that student until the test. You can share the responsibility with another, but it must be intense and helpful for aspiring, hardworking students who come from underserved schools. THIS ASK IS TO ASSIST CURRENT 8TH GRADE STUDENTS, they need assistance urgently. Hours - At Grand Army Library - anytime between 9 am and 6 pm on Saturdays and 1-5 pm on Sundays. We can find other times and other locations. Children come from central Brooklyn (Crown Heights, etc) Background - We also have an initiative with Seeds in the Middle to give every child a chance to learn the academic skills to gain entry into New York City's top high schools - starting as early as 3rd or 4th grade. Why? Despite increasing funding and initiatives, the percentage of African-American and Latino students in NYC is far below their numbers in the NYC population. See the article here - showing in 2017 that only 10 percent of the seats offered went to minority students. https://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2017/03/08/only-10-percent-of-offers-at-new-york-citys-specialized-high-schools-went-to-black-and-hispanic-students/ Who are we? Seeds in the Middle has been working with students, faculties and parents and the community in central Brooklyn since 2010. We have seen the challenges and want to work closely with people who care to give children real chances to get the same access to top colleges as those in more affluent communities. We think we have an innovative solution to helping students achieve so they can have an equal shot at these schools - including competitive schools like LaGuardia High School of Performing Arts or Midwood or Murrow or any other school recognized as top by the most competitive colleges. That's you! Help us create a new pathway for students! Empower real change. THIS FALL - Volunteers are asked to commit at least two hours a week and hopefully 8 or more hours a week until the test which will be held in October or early November. ATTENTION - beyond this fall test, if you want to tutor younger ages or do anything further, read below For the long-term plan, WE ask for commitments of at least three months, or you can work for years with a student on special skills. You must: sign that commitment when you finish your term, explain to the next tutor what you are working on with the student confer with our certified educators for guidance so you know exactly what they need to work on. STUDENTS - WE CAN GIVE COMMUNITY SERVICE HOURS FOR THIS. Locations? May vary - it might be Brooklyn Central Library near Grand Army Plaza or a school in Brownsville, Flatbush or Crown Heights, Brooklyn or maybe right at Stuyvesant High School or one of the top high schools. If you have a location near a train, let us know. Who are the students you will tutor? Each student must write a letter or essay, saying why he or she wants to go to a top high school and signing, with a parent, their commitment to coming every week for as long as it takes. We are starting at 3rd or 4th grade, and offer this to students through 8th grade. We hope to launch this on MLK weekend 2018 - so respond right away. PS - We would like to ask every volunteer to donate $50 or anything to help support our efforts. If you just want to tutor and cannot give, that is okay. But this is an unfunded program, so we are asking for donations to pay the people who are creating and organizing these opportunities and to administer this. All donations are tax-deductible. If you are willing to fundraise at all - even a bake sale - for our efforts, we would truly appreciate. Our goal is $20,000 and we want to offer tutors to as many children who want it - can be 100 or more... you can see what we do at seedsinthemiddle.org and on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/seedsinthemiddle/ What is our goal? To get at least 20 students into any of these schools, maybe more. But our initial goal is to ensure at least 20 students get the education necessary to pass the specialized high school test or other tests to go to the school of their choice - who - WITHOUT YOU - would never get a chance to get in. More info? Email - info@seedsinthemiddle.org Please write us and tell us: Who you are Days you are available What is your commitment - how many weeks at 2 x a week Where are you willing to travel? Will you go to Brownsville or central library? Why you want to do this?

Do you remember the elementary school thrill of an approving teacher's remark or the electrifying rush of receiving a supportive, handwritten note on your homework? We need your help to create that feeling for thousands of kids around New York who need it the most. Story Love nights provide an opportunity for children to present their stories to helpful, supportive adults for feedback and commentary. WHAT WE'LL BE DOING: When you come to the Story Love night, a Story Pirate will do a brief introduction, go over the process for writing thoughtful and positive comments on each story, and facilitate discussion as your group reads the funny, touching, heartwarming, and sometimes heart-wrenching stories that NYC's kids write. At the end of the evening, you will have provided young people with the affirmation they need to call themselves writers - and you'll have shared some laughs, and maybe tears, from the stories. Story Love evenings are entertaining as well as productive. WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW: Story Pirates has been providing arts education - and giving Story Love - since 2003. This is your chance to lend a hand to a budding writer. Who knows what future talent you may uncover or who you may encouage and inspire to keep exploring the world through writing. WHERE TO MEET: We'll be meeting at the Drama Bookshop on W. 40th St at 7:30 pm. STORY PIRATES: Story Pirates (www.storypirates.org) is a nationally respected arts and creative writing organization that celebrates the words and ideas of young people, promotes literacy as a vital part of early childhood education, and preserves the spark of youthful creativity often lost in the transition to adulthood.

Our events at Rescuing Leftover Cuisine typically last 30 minutes (Some events are longer, some are shorter). On each event, we rescue an average of 50 pounds of food, which feeds about 40 people.

RLC provides services such as food waste consulting, excess food delivery, co-branding services, and tax credit assistance. RLC approaches the two large issues of hunger and food waste in three main ways. First, we localize the issues into sets of communities that can help sustain themselves. We crowdsource the solution of the transportation to the members of the public in these communities as volunteers. After identifying the homeless shelters of a needy community, we proactively find restaurants, hotels, and catering companies with excess food in that vicinity that could help support these disadvantaged communities. Second, we leverage technology to facilitate the identification and handling of excess food. Thus, partner food providers report when excess food is occurring and a web application is used to engage community members, because volunteering with us can be as easy as taking a brisk walk. Third, we tackle food waste at its root, aiming to eliminate as much food waste as possible and bringing the remaining excess food to where it is needed most. The data of when food waste occurs is used in our analysis of what types of food waste could be avoided, and RLC suggests ways that partner food providers can reduce waste at its root.", "title": "Volunteer with One Brick and Rescuing Leftover Cuisine", "zipcode": "10013", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D3020298%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "ONE BRICK"}, {"end": "2018-12-31", "description": "Interested in shooting on the Red Carpet for a celebrity gala?
