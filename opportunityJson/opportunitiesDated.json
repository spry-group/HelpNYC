Curriculum is provided by the Wa-Shokuiku Project. Supervise children participants, ensuring proper hygiene, meal creation, and clean up. Facilitate class discussions of concepts of Japanese cuisine and food education, allowing participants to brainstorm how they might put new knowledge and food education concepts into action, discuss barriers to adopting new concepts, and share ideas with their peers.
