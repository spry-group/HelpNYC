ABOUT PKD Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is one of the most common, life-threatening genetic diseases affecting thousands in America and millions worldwide. There is no treatment or cure. You can help bring a treatment within reach. Polycystic Kidney Disease causes fluid filled cysts to form on both kidneys. Over time, these cysts grow and multiply, sometimes dramatically in size. For most patients, their PKD ultimately causes the kidneys to shut down. Once that happens, dialysis and transplant are their only options to prolong life. Parents with the dominant form of PKD have a 50% chance of passing the disease on to each of their children. For the recessive form, ARPKD, parents have usually never heard of PKD until their newborn is diagnosed with it. For 30% of newborns, ARPKD is fatal.

A CASA is integral in helping the Court in determining the appropriate permanent plan for the child. We ensure abuse and neglect doesn&rsquo;t continue at the hand&rsquo;s of the court. A CASA forges a connection with the child/children they are matched with. They build their trust and discover what their needs are. Once a month they visit with their assigned child. Advocates examine the child's health and education records and meet with their caregivers, school, therapists and other professionals. Once they identify what the child&rsquo;s needs are, they write a report and advocate for a child&rsquo;s needs in court. Our staff and peer coordinators are with you every step of the way to support you and help you succeed. No special skills or specific backgrounds are needed.

In 1998, the Children&rsquo;s Defense Fund reported that violent crime by young people ages 10-17 peaks between 3 and 7 PM; children and teens in poor neighborhoods are struggling for direction and positive opportunities are needed to keep them safe and on-track; a great majority of all American fourth graders cannot read or do math at grade level, including more than five of six black children. In addition, a study published in Pediatrics magazine found that eighth graders who were left alone after school reported greater use of cigarettes, marijuana, and alcohol than those in adult-supervised settings. Current research indicates that supervised after-school and summer programs not only keep children safe and out of trouble, they also significantly improve their academic achievement. PROJECT DESCRIPTION Teaching high-risk, inner-city Youth the skills to become successful in life is at the core of the ACN SUMMER YOUTH CAPACITY BUILDING program. The Four(4) major components of the program are: *Homework Assistance through tutoring, mentoring and Use of Computer labs. *Nutrition Education to promote healthy lifestyles and Combat Obesity. *Life Skills which are integrated throughout all phases of the program. *Soccer Instructions where participants engage in fun physical fitness, enjoy the camaraderie of playing in a soccer team format with friends and peers, and learn to become responsible adolescents and adults. The summer After-School Program- will serve approximately 600 children which includes academic tutoring five(5) hours per week and Soccer Instruction, Health and life skills education ten(10) hours per week. Participants will receive Soccer Instruction in professional settings and practice skills in team format play. They will learn about the rules of the game, etiquette, sportsmanship, positive attitudes, fair play, self-esteem, taking responsibility for choices and management of emotions. These life skills are integrated throughout the Soccer program, and instructors routinely demonstrate how they apply to situations in all aspects of life. Nutrition and Healthy lifestyles are stressed both in the Classroom setting and on the Soccer Field. Healthy Snacks will be provided. The ACN YOUTH CAPACITY BUILDING program is Fortunate to have a corpse of Volunteers willing to dedicate to the program and are available to work with the children on improving their academic skills. Seeking Volunteers from some of the community based Universities/colleges who will take an active role in the homework area, working individually with the students using current homework assignments. In the computer lab, Volunteer tutors will help the students improve their keyboarding skills and show them how to use the computer for research. They will read aloud with the students and give quizzes on tapes and videos to improve comprehension.

I have meet some of the most unique, passionate and inspiring people. Not to mention the out of the box thinkers, legal whiz's, rule & procedures gurus and fierce parents and grandparents looking for their next adventure. And if you've been to one of my sessions than you know that by the end of the informal presentation we are all on a first name basis with one another, hopefully exchanging social media info or cell numbers. As we walk back out that door we are ready to greet Saturday morning with a little more bounce in our step. So who will we be meeting this weekend? Won't you join us?
