CPAs, Attorneys, and Enrolled Agents also receive Continuing Education Credits upon completion of volunteer service in this program.

What is nXu? nXu is a non-profit organization and an innovative youth purpose incubator that offers programming to help high school students explore, articulate, and pursue their purpose in life. This fall, nXu is launching a selective, 1-year, out-of-school fellowship program in San Antonio, Seattle, and New York City. The program brings together ~30 10th graders from a range of district, charter, private and parochial schools to form an intentionally diverse cohort that bridges race, gender, and class lines. During the school year, nXu Fellows gather twice per month for immersive sessions led by our Lead Compass Coach and a team of volunteer Compass Coaches. What is the volunteer opportunity? We are looking for passionate volunteer Compass Coaches who are excited to lead 10th grade nXu Fellows through this year-long Purpose Exploration journey. Using our curriculum, each volunteer Compass Coach will guide their Compass Team (~8 participants) through a series of pre-scripted and planned immersive activities, conversations, exercises, and reflections. With support from Compass Coaches, Fellows will form valuable bonds and expand their self-knowledge. We are looking for volunteer Compass Coaches who: Represent a range of identity markers and professional experiences. Show an interest in exploring their own self-development. Are eager to share their personal and professional wisdom and experiences. Are intellectually curious, vulnerable, and ready to have a good time. Are excited to be trained in providing an inclusive and engaging experience for students. Demonstrate excellent interpersonal and communication skills and are capable of delivering pre-scripted content. Want to guide nXu participants to reach their desired life purpose goals and help them reflect on various experiences. What is the time commitment? We ask that volunteer Compass Coaches attend: A training session-dates will be scheduled based on volunteer Compass Coach availability. The All-Day Launch Retreat from 9:00 AM - 9:00 PM. All subsequent 13 sessions. (See our website for dates and times). We are open to volunteers who may not be able to make every single session. What else should I know? nXu will set you up for success. Our team will ensure that volunteer Compass Coaches are positioned for success by providing thorough training in orientation and continuous coaching throughout the Fellowship volunteer experience. Volunteer Compass Coaches will receive pre-scripted session plans in order to successfully execute our curriculum. nXu sessions are designed so that everyone who participates-including Compass Coaches-has the opportunity to learn from our curriculum. During each immersive session, the Lead Compass Coach (head facilitator) will set the tone and orient the nXu Fellows to the day&rsquo;s learning objectives. With support from the Lead Compass Coach, volunteer Compass Coaches will guide the nXu Fellows through the day and support them in learning the session&rsquo;s objective through a series of engaging activities/practices, reflections, and authentic conversations. Volunteer Compass Coaches will build a culture of curiosity and vulnerability, ask questions, lead discussions, share their own experiences, and actively engage in the day&rsquo;s activities with the Fellows. Compass Coaches will walk away from each session having contributed to the development of the Fellows, while also learning something new about themselves.

CASA-NYC is a non-profit organization that advocates on behalf of the best interests of 1,000 youth and children in the NYC foster care system every year. We have seen great success since our inception in 1979, as our volunteer advocates go above and beyond to aid children and youth in foster care to move into or to secure permanent, safe and loving homes. The first event we need help with is a Swearing-in Ceremony for new advocates, whichwill take placeon November 8th, 2018 from 3-4:30 in downtown Manhattan. The lighting in the room where the ceremony takes place is very dark and in the past we have had difficulty in capturing quality photos of this important event. We'd like photographs of the ceremony and the presentation of certificates to our advocates. To volunteer please contact: volunteer@casa-nyc.com Thank you kindly for your consideration.
