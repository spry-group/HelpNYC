Civic Art Lab 2017 is the third iteration of the project, designed as a pop-up gallery and workshop space in the East Village at Avenue C & 7th Street. The lab will be hosted in partnership with Marc Norov and the Creations Gallery, a mixed-use community pop-up space, adjacent to a community-based bike repair shop. Our programming will continue to be low cost for full registrants and free for individual registrants. These workshops, talks, and exhibitions are designed by volunteer artists, designers, and teachers who lead investigations into diverse themes such as: creative re-use; urban agriculture; sustainable architecture; health & well-being, and environmental justice, to name a few. Civic Art Lab is hosted by GreenspaceNYC (www.greenspacenyc.org), a non-profit collaborative that develops and curates free educational programming, hands-on workshops, and public design projects that encourage dialogue, enliven public spaces, and promote the future of more equitable and sustainable cities.
