Put your passion for mental health issues to work by gathering support for the run/walk in your community. This includes attracting participants, donations, sponsors and volunteers. And know we are here to support you every step of the way! Finding Participants: Below are some suggested ways to draw more participants to your local Five Fifty Fifty Run/Walk event. Keep in mind we will be doing social media advertising, email blasts and press releases in each market. \uf0b7 Distribute flyers and post cards (we will provide the materials) \uf0b7 Speak to civic groups, school groups and other organizations with a focus on mental health \uf0b7 Use social media to spread the word \uf0b7 Visit local running stores and running clubs to talk up the event (make sure to take flyers with you!) \uf0b7 Encourage groups of any kind to participate. They can create a team through our online registration system and members can sign up for the team during the registration process. Finding Donations: Funds raised from run/walk registrations are crucial, but account for less than half of our revenue. Donations are another important source of funding in our mission. Here are some suggestions for raising money for the Five Fifty Fifty cause: \uf0b7 Encourage participants to make a donation during the registration process. The registration site gives them the option of doing this. \uf0b7 Encourage participants to set up their own fundraising page and solicit donations that way. \uf0b7 Ask participating groups to set a fundraising goal and help them achieve it by offering prizes such as gift cards and apparel. Finding Sponsors: The final piece of our funding puzzle is through corporate sponsorships. We have found there are many businesses and organizations who share our passion for mental health issues. It&rsquo;s just a matter of finding them. You can reach out to local businesses and organizations for sponsorship. They can sponsor our local event or even become a regional or national sponsor. There are different sponsorship levels at the local/state, regional and national levels. We will send you an electronic version of our sponsor sheet. You are encouraged to email this document to any potential sponsors, or print and hand-deliver it if you are meeting in person. If you would like to bring in a Five Fifty Fifty staff member for assistance in the process, we are happy to help. In addition to cash sponsorships, we are looking for in-kind sponsors to help offset costs for things like food and drinks at the events, advertising and printing. Finding Volunteers: We will need anywhere from 5 to 15 volunteers, depending on the location, at each Five Fifty Fifty Run/Walk event. We will provide you with a list of positions needed about one month prior to the event. When you are out in the community promoting the run/walk to groups and individuals, keep in mind the need for volunteers and take down information if someone asks how they can help. One of your duties in the weeks leading up to the race will be coordinating the volunteers and making sure there are enough people to fill the spots. Your Role on Event Day: As a captain, we ask that you take a leadership role on the day of the run/walk. You are welcome to participate as a runner or walker, but we also expect you to assist our staff in setting up the event site, coordinating volunteers and answering questions from participants. We will have a 2-3 person staff onsite for the event. They will oversee course setup and teardown. Questions?

Put your passion for mental health issues to work by gathering support for the run/walk in your community. This includes attracting participants, donations, sponsors and volunteers. And know we are here to support you every step of the way! Finding Participants: Below are some suggested ways to draw more participants to your local Five Fifty Fifty Run/Walk event. Keep in mind we will be doing social media advertising, email blasts and press releases in each market. \uf0b7 Distribute flyers and post cards (we will provide the materials) \uf0b7 Speak to civic groups, school groups and other organizations with a focus on mental health \uf0b7 Use social media to spread the word \uf0b7 Visit local running stores and running clubs to talk up the event (make sure to take flyers with you!) \uf0b7 Encourage groups of any kind to participate. They can create a team through our online registration system and members can sign up for the team during the registration process. Finding Donations: Funds raised from run/walk registrations are crucial, but account for less than half of our revenue. Donations are another important source of funding in our mission. Here are some suggestions for raising money for the Five Fifty Fifty cause: \uf0b7 Encourage participants to make a donation during the registration process. The registration site gives them the option of doing this. \uf0b7 Encourage participants to set up their own fundraising page and solicit donations that way. \uf0b7 Ask participating groups to set a fundraising goal and help them achieve it by offering prizes such as gift cards and apparel. Finding Sponsors: The final piece of our funding puzzle is through corporate sponsorships. We have found there are many businesses and organizations who share our passion for mental health issues. It&rsquo;s just a matter of finding them. You can reach out to local businesses and organizations for sponsorship. They can sponsor our local event or even become a regional or national sponsor. There are different sponsorship levels at the local/state, regional and national levels. We will send you an electronic version of our sponsor sheet. You are encouraged to email this document to any potential sponsors, or print and hand-deliver it if you are meeting in person. If you would like to bring in a Five Fifty Fifty staff member for assistance in the process, we are happy to help. In addition to cash sponsorships, we are looking for in-kind sponsors to help offset costs for things like food and drinks at the events, advertising and printing. Finding Volunteers: We will need anywhere from 5 to 15 volunteers, depending on the location, at each Five Fifty Fifty Run/Walk event. We will provide you with a list of positions needed about one month prior to the event. When you are out in the community promoting the run/walk to groups and individuals, keep in mind the need for volunteers and take down information if someone asks how they can help. One of your duties in the weeks leading up to the race will be coordinating the volunteers and making sure there are enough people to fill the spots. Your Role on Event Day: As a captain, we ask that you take a leadership role on the day of the run/walk. You are welcome to participate as a runner or walker, but we also expect you to assist our staff in setting up the event site, coordinating volunteers and answering questions from participants. We will have a 2-3 person staff onsite for the event. They will oversee course setup and teardown. Questions?

Put your passion for mental health issues to work by gathering support for the run/walk in your community. This includes attracting participants, donations, sponsors and volunteers. And know we are here to support you every step of the way! Finding Participants: Below are some suggested ways to draw more participants to your local Five Fifty Fifty Run/Walk event. Keep in mind we will be doing social media advertising, email blasts and press releases in each market. \uf0b7 Distribute flyers and post cards (we will provide the materials) \uf0b7 Speak to civic groups, school groups and other organizations with a focus on mental health \uf0b7 Use social media to spread the word \uf0b7 Visit local running stores and running clubs to talk up the event (make sure to take flyers with you!) \uf0b7 Encourage groups of any kind to participate. They can create a team through our online registration system and members can sign up for the team during the registration process. Finding Donations: Funds raised from run/walk registrations are crucial, but account for less than half of our revenue. Donations are another important source of funding in our mission. Here are some suggestions for raising money for the Five Fifty Fifty cause: \uf0b7 Encourage participants to make a donation during the registration process. The registration site gives them the option of doing this. \uf0b7 Encourage participants to set up their own fundraising page and solicit donations that way. \uf0b7 Ask participating groups to set a fundraising goal and help them achieve it by offering prizes such as gift cards and apparel. Finding Sponsors: The final piece of our funding puzzle is through corporate sponsorships. We have found there are many businesses and organizations who share our passion for mental health issues. It&rsquo;s just a matter of finding them. You can reach out to local businesses and organizations for sponsorship. They can sponsor our local event or even become a regional or national sponsor. There are different sponsorship levels at the local/state, regional and national levels. We will send you an electronic version of our sponsor sheet. You are encouraged to email this document to any potential sponsors, or print and hand-deliver it if you are meeting in person. If you would like to bring in a Five Fifty Fifty staff member for assistance in the process, we are happy to help. In addition to cash sponsorships, we are looking for in-kind sponsors to help offset costs for things like food and drinks at the events, advertising and printing. Finding Volunteers: We will need anywhere from 5 to 15 volunteers, depending on the location, at each Five Fifty Fifty Run/Walk event. We will provide you with a list of positions needed about one month prior to the event. When you are out in the community promoting the run/walk to groups and individuals, keep in mind the need for volunteers and take down information if someone asks how they can help. One of your duties in the weeks leading up to the race will be coordinating the volunteers and making sure there are enough people to fill the spots. Your Role on Event Day: As a captain, we ask that you take a leadership role on the day of the run/walk. You are welcome to participate as a runner or walker, but we also expect you to assist our staff in setting up the event site, coordinating volunteers and answering questions from participants. We will have a 2-3 person staff onsite for the event. They will oversee course setup and teardown. Questions?

This can serve 58,064,516,129 meals using the national average amount spent on a meal, $2.79. In order to address this issue of waster, Rescuing Leftover Cuisine helps bring food from our partners to a local homeless shelter. It takes less than an hour and you can set your own schedule, whether you want to help out daily, weekly, or sporadically. Our events at Rescuing Leftover Cuisine typically last 30 minutes (Some events are longer, some are shorter). On each event, we rescue an average of 50 pounds of food, which feeds about 40 people. It only take 30 minutes to help feed over 40 people! WHAT WE'LL BE DOING: Help rescue some prepared food and drinks from a restaurant in Midtown West! Heavyweight: the average amount of food rescued from this event is enough for a group of around five or so people. WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW: Please be aware volunteers should be able to carry a bag of food for a 15 to 30 minute walk. This event happens rain or shine. WHERE TO MEET: Please meet inside the Two Forks restaurant RESCUING LEFTOVER CUISINE: Rescuing Leftover Cuisine is a national 501(c)3 non-profit food rescue organization, operating in 16 cities and headquartered in New York City, that provides solutions to prevent excess wholesome cuisine from being wasted. RLC provides services such as food waste consulting, excess food delivery, co-branding services, and tax credit assistance. RLC approaches the two large issues of hunger and food waste in three main ways. First, we localize the issues into sets of communities that can help sustain themselves. We crowdsource the solution of the transportation to the members of the public in these communities as volunteers. After identifying the homeless shelters of a needy community, we proactively find restaurants, hotels, and catering companies with excess food in that vicinity that could help support these disadvantaged communities. Second, we leverage technology to facilitate the identification and handling of excess food. Thus, partner food providers report when excess food is occurring and a web application is used to engage community members, because volunteering with us can be as easy as taking a brisk walk. Third, we tackle food waste at its root, aiming to eliminate as much food waste as possible and bringing the remaining excess food to where it is needed most. The data of when food waste occurs is used in our analysis of what types of food waste could be avoided, and RLC suggests ways that partner food providers can reduce waste at its root.", "title": "Volunteer with One Brick and Rescuing Leftover Cuisine", "zipcode": "10018", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D3137579%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "ONE BRICK"}, {"end": "2019-06-06", "description": "Ubuntu Pathways breaks the cycle of poverty by providing South Africa's most vulnerable children with what all children deserve-everything, every day.
