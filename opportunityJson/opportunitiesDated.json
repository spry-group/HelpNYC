Put your passion for mental health issues to work by gathering support for the run/walk in your community. This includes attracting participants, donations, sponsors and volunteers. And know we are here to support you every step of the way! Finding Participants: Below are some suggested ways to draw more participants to your local Five Fifty Fifty Run/Walk event. Keep in mind we will be doing social media advertising, email blasts and press releases in each market. \uf0b7 Distribute flyers and post cards (we will provide the materials) \uf0b7 Speak to civic groups, school groups and other organizations with a focus on mental health \uf0b7 Use social media to spread the word \uf0b7 Visit local running stores and running clubs to talk up the event (make sure to take flyers with you!) \uf0b7 Encourage groups of any kind to participate. They can create a team through our online registration system and members can sign up for the team during the registration process. Finding Donations: Funds raised from run/walk registrations are crucial, but account for less than half of our revenue. Donations are another important source of funding in our mission. Here are some suggestions for raising money for the Five Fifty Fifty cause: \uf0b7 Encourage participants to make a donation during the registration process. The registration site gives them the option of doing this. \uf0b7 Encourage participants to set up their own fundraising page and solicit donations that way. \uf0b7 Ask participating groups to set a fundraising goal and help them achieve it by offering prizes such as gift cards and apparel. Finding Sponsors: The final piece of our funding puzzle is through corporate sponsorships. We have found there are many businesses and organizations who share our passion for mental health issues. It&rsquo;s just a matter of finding them. You can reach out to local businesses and organizations for sponsorship. They can sponsor our local event or even become a regional or national sponsor. There are different sponsorship levels at the local/state, regional and national levels. We will send you an electronic version of our sponsor sheet. You are encouraged to email this document to any potential sponsors, or print and hand-deliver it if you are meeting in person. If you would like to bring in a Five Fifty Fifty staff member for assistance in the process, we are happy to help. In addition to cash sponsorships, we are looking for in-kind sponsors to help offset costs for things like food and drinks at the events, advertising and printing. Finding Volunteers: We will need anywhere from 5 to 15 volunteers, depending on the location, at each Five Fifty Fifty Run/Walk event. We will provide you with a list of positions needed about one month prior to the event. When you are out in the community promoting the run/walk to groups and individuals, keep in mind the need for volunteers and take down information if someone asks how they can help. One of your duties in the weeks leading up to the race will be coordinating the volunteers and making sure there are enough people to fill the spots. Your Role on Event Day: As a captain, we ask that you take a leadership role on the day of the run/walk. You are welcome to participate as a runner or walker, but we also expect you to assist our staff in setting up the event site, coordinating volunteers and answering questions from participants. We will have a 2-3 person staff onsite for the event. They will oversee course setup and teardown. Questions?

Camp AmeriKids is a one-week free summer camp for youth ages 8-16 who are infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS and/or sickle cell disease. We work with youth who might not normally be able to attend camp because of medical concerns and provide them with a traditional summer camp experience - all free of charge. We have a comprehensive medical team living at camp, available 24/7, which allows youth living with sickle cell, HIV/AIDS and other chronic illnesses to have a great time at camp while their families can be assured their health and well-being are monitored. In addition to our healthcare staff, we have a Wellness team overseen by a mental health professional. There is one child specialist assigned to each age group to assist counselors and staff members in managing any challenges associated with living in a new environment. The entire camp staff volunteer their time and energy to provide this incredible one-week experience for our youth. While we understand the difficulty in fully disengaging from the outside world, we expect volunteers to be present and engaged at all times to help create a fun, loving and safe environment for both staff and campers. Volunteers are given two nights off after campers have gone to bed and one period off each day to take a nap, grab a coffee or call home. Besides daily lessons in dance, drama, sports, arts & crafts, spoken word and more, we have a slew of special events. These include an evening luau, day at the carnival, a talent show and of course - campfires and s&rsquo;mores! Given the responsibilities involved in caring for children and the unique nature of our program, we take every precaution and screen all applicants extensively to ensure a good match. All volunteers are provided with housing and meals for the week. Mandatory orientation on Saturday, August 3 rd will acquaint you with camp and fellow volunteers to prepare before the campers arrive. Descriptions for cabin counselors, program and operations staff and preferred qualifications are below. To apply, please fill out a Volunteer Application online.

CABIN COUNSELORS A team of counselors is responsible for the 24-hour supervision of a cabin and maintains a 2:1 camper to counselor ratio. The cabin counselor&rsquo;s enthusiastic participation in all aspects of camp is crucial in creating a memorable experience for our campers. We expect counselors to be completely engaged and participate in the fun alongside the kids - whether that&rsquo;s hopping in the pool, trying a new sport, or dancing on stage! Counselors are expected to be leaders and role models, as well as sources of energy and ideas. They are a key part of the Camp AmeriKids community. Qualifications Experience working with children Excellent team player and leadership skills Strong interpersonal and communications skills Flexible, energetic and creative (having skills or talents to teach campers is a plus!)

Program staff facilitate learning and fun for campers in their area of expertise (i.e. dance, arts & crafts, sports). Each day, cabins will visit different program areas and participate in 45-minute activity periods. We expect program staff to come prepared with activities for campers of various age groups to learn and participate in - and be flexible when the schedule changes! In addition, we offer older campers (ages 12-16) the opportunity to choose a dedicated program area to attend every afternoon and work on a \\\"weekly project\\\" with a larger group.

Put your passion for mental health issues to work by gathering support for the run/walk in your community. This includes attracting participants, donations, sponsors and volunteers. And know we are here to support you every step of the way! Finding Participants: Below are some suggested ways to draw more participants to your local Five Fifty Fifty Run/Walk event. Keep in mind we will be doing social media advertising, email blasts and press releases in each market. \uf0b7 Distribute flyers and post cards (we will provide the materials) \uf0b7 Speak to civic groups, school groups and other organizations with a focus on mental health \uf0b7 Use social media to spread the word \uf0b7 Visit local running stores and running clubs to talk up the event (make sure to take flyers with you!) \uf0b7 Encourage groups of any kind to participate. They can create a team through our online registration system and members can sign up for the team during the registration process. Finding Donations: Funds raised from run/walk registrations are crucial, but account for less than half of our revenue. Donations are another important source of funding in our mission. Here are some suggestions for raising money for the Five Fifty Fifty cause: \uf0b7 Encourage participants to make a donation during the registration process. The registration site gives them the option of doing this. \uf0b7 Encourage participants to set up their own fundraising page and solicit donations that way. \uf0b7 Ask participating groups to set a fundraising goal and help them achieve it by offering prizes such as gift cards and apparel. Finding Sponsors: The final piece of our funding puzzle is through corporate sponsorships. We have found there are many businesses and organizations who share our passion for mental health issues. It&rsquo;s just a matter of finding them. You can reach out to local businesses and organizations for sponsorship. They can sponsor our local event or even become a regional or national sponsor. There are different sponsorship levels at the local/state, regional and national levels. We will send you an electronic version of our sponsor sheet. You are encouraged to email this document to any potential sponsors, or print and hand-deliver it if you are meeting in person. If you would like to bring in a Five Fifty Fifty staff member for assistance in the process, we are happy to help. In addition to cash sponsorships, we are looking for in-kind sponsors to help offset costs for things like food and drinks at the events, advertising and printing. Finding Volunteers: We will need anywhere from 5 to 15 volunteers, depending on the location, at each Five Fifty Fifty Run/Walk event. We will provide you with a list of positions needed about one month prior to the event. When you are out in the community promoting the run/walk to groups and individuals, keep in mind the need for volunteers and take down information if someone asks how they can help. One of your duties in the weeks leading up to the race will be coordinating the volunteers and making sure there are enough people to fill the spots. Your Role on Event Day: As a captain, we ask that you take a leadership role on the day of the run/walk. You are welcome to participate as a runner or walker, but we also expect you to assist our staff in setting up the event site, coordinating volunteers and answering questions from participants. We will have a 2-3 person staff onsite for the event. They will oversee course setup and teardown. Questions?

Our NPCA office is located at 256 W 36th St, 12th floor. Due to the limited number of wristbands, we can only provide one wristband per person, and you can only claim a wristband for yourself. THE OFFICE WILL CLOSE AT 12:00 PM, so that we can make our way to the March lineup location. We hope you can join us!
