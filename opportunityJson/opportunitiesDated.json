In advance of the event, volunteers are needed to spread the word throughout Westchester County (& beyond!). We're at a new location this year, hoping this will draw new participants, donors, and event sponsors ... so we need YOU to help make that happen! Here are just a few of the ways you can get involved: Make phone calls to local community groups, houses of worship, schools. medical centers, and businesses to discuss opportunities to get involved. Depending on how these calls go, they could be followed up with a volunteer dropping off material or a more substantial meeting with me to discuss these opportunities Go door-to-door to local merchants, asking if they'd be willing to post flyers in their windows, on their bulletin boards, and/or by their registers While you're there, you can ask if they'd be willing to donate items for our participants or our raffle, or if they'd be interested in becoming a sponsor. Gather/pack SWAG Bags - these will be given to participants at the event, filled with information & items from local businesses & organizations. Pick up/Drop off materials - this may include picking up packages from merchant/donors and dropping them off to me (in Mamaroneck), picking up items from me and bringing them to the event itself, and/or picking up packages from me and bringing them to local sponsors in the week or two following the event.

We will support the Monday and Wednesday course from 2 - 3:15 pm, or Friday from 12PM - 2:30PM. Let us know which course date works for you. Our course support will be determined based on tutor time availability. This is a great opportunity especially for students who are majoring (or have already earned a degree) in sociology, or who are social science majors/minors. All majors are welcome to apply. Tutors will get to enhance their understanding of writing composition and gain professional experience and references that they can leverage for future opportunities. As a tutor, you would identify students struggling, provide feedback to the instructor regarding students' concerns and difficulties that can lead to changes in future lessons, conduct virtual study groups, and allow students to submit parts of their writing for review before final drafts are submitted.

Training days will be determined based on your schedule and that of the Tutor Training Coordinators. CT's embedded tutoring program has been successful in helping students gain access to support that they otherwise would not have received, given their limited time spent on campus. Having a tutor in the class early in the semester will allow us to employ strategies to reduce withdrawals and student failure rates.

NYC Free Tax Prep sites are operated by community-based organizations in partnership with the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DWCP). As Brooklyn&rsquo;s largest noncommercial tax provider, we have grown to cover most of central Brooklyn along with southern Brooklyn. This is, in large part, thanks to our volunteer tax preparers. Volunteer Tax Preparers will be tasked with completing high quality tax returns for low- and middle-income Brooklynites. Our ideal tax preparer would have a high interest and motivation for building on their tax preparation experience. They should also have a passion for helping the members of our community who need it most. Most of all, our volunteers should be able to practice patience, good customer service skills, and have a great sense of humor! This is a great opportunity to build valuable work experience, meet new friends, and help people who need it. Benefits Wide ranging benefits include learning new skills or building on valuable professional experience with active work duties. We have served as professional references for many of our volunteers. CPAs, Attorneys, and Enrolled Agents also receive Continuing Education Credits upon completion of volunteer service in this program. Build a sense of achievement for directly positively affecting your fellow Brooklynites by providing them with top quality tax service without the predatory service fees associated with retail tax providers. If that isn&rsquo;t enough for you to sign up, we&rsquo;ll also provide snacks. General Requirements All volunteers are welcome! If you don't have any tax experience, no problem! We provide training.

We support these local nonprofits by creating a friendly and social atmosphere around volunteering. We provide a calendar of volunteer and social events to help people get involved, have an impact, and have fun, without the requirements of long term commitments. We provide a flexible way for you to volunteer where and when you want. After each volunteer event our volunteer team invites everyone to gather at a local restaurant or coffee shop where they can get to know one another in a relaxed social setting. Additionally we host regular social events for our volunteers to connect to one another and to welcome new volunteers to our community. The non-profit we will be helping for this upcoming volunteer event is the Story Pirates. ABOUT THE EVENT Story Pirates wants every kid to know that their stories are important. Do you remember the elementary school thrill of an approving teacher's remark or the electrifying rush of receiving a supportive, handwritten note on your homework? We need your help to create that feeling for thousands of kids around the world. Story Love nights provide an opportunity for you to read stories written by children from all over the world and provide supportive feedback and commentary. This way every child receives handwritte n feedback on their story! Kids are not present at Story Love events, but their stories are! WHAT WE'LL BE DOING: When you come to the Story Love night, a Story Pirate will do a brief introduction, go over the process for writing thoughtful and positive comments on each story, and facilitate discussion as your group reads the funny, touching, heartwarming, and sometimes heart-wrenching stories that kids write. At the end of the evening, you will have provided young people with the affirmation they need to call themselves writers-and you'll have shared some laughs, and maybe tears, from the stories. Story Love evenings are entertaining and productive. WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW: Story Pirates has been providing arts education-and giving Story Love-since 2003. This is your chance to lend a hand to a budding writer. Who knows what future talent you may uncover or who you may encourage and inspire to keep exploring the world through writing. WHERE TO MEET: Story Pirates has a new permanent location! Just let the doorman know you are a guest of the Story Pirates and head up to the 7th floor. The Story Pirates are located in Suite 701, directly across from the elevator bank. STORY PIRATES: Story Pirates (www.storypirates.org) is a nationally respected arts and creative writing organization that celebrates the words and ideas of young people, promotes literacy as a vital part of early childhood education, and preserves the spark of youthful creativity often lost in the transition to adulthood.
