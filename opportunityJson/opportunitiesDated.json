Tutors will coordinate with each other, and work closely with the instructor. Tutors will be supported through the process by the City Tutors staff. We will support the Monday and Wednesday course from 2 - 3:15 pm, or Friday from 12PM - 2:30PM. Let us know which course date works for you. Our course support will be determined based on tutor time availability. This is a great opportunity especially for students who are majoring (or have already earned a degree) in sociology, or who are social science majors/minors. All majors are welcome to apply. Tutors will get to enhance their understanding of writing composition and gain professional experience and references that they can leverage for future opportunities. As a tutor, you would identify students struggling, provide feedback to the instructor regarding students' concerns and difficulties that can lead to changes in future lessons, conduct virtual study groups, and allow students to submit parts of their writing for review before final drafts are submitted.

This is a commitment of 7.5 hours of in person training, and 4 hours of supplemental training for a total of 11.5 hours of training (4.5 hours if you have prior tutoring/teaching experience) over the course of the semester. Training days will be determined based on your schedule and that of the Tutor Training Coordinators. CT's embedded tutoring program has been successful in helping students gain access to support that they otherwise would not have received, given their limited time spent on campus. Having a tutor in the class early in the semester will allow us to employ strategies to reduce withdrawals and student failure rates. Your work with us would help the students&rsquo; overall subject area performance, and help us improve this educational support model, reaching more students and departments with comprehensive academic support. To apply, you must: Have received an A- or A in the introduction to the subject course you are applying to tutor Have a GPA at or above 3.2, or have completed a degree program Submit monthly reports, keep a log sheet of any tutoring appointments done outside of class, and regularly communicate with the tutor training coordinator.
