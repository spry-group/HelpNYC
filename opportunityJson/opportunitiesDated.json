On any given day, more than 350 children from Middlesex County are living in foster care. Now, more than ever, we need you. A child with a CASA is more likely to find a permanent home, spend less time in foster care, and perform better in school. Champion one of these children from your community and safeguard a child&rsquo;s well being through advocacy in the court today. What does a CASA do? A CASA is integral in helping the Court in determining the appropriate permanent plan for the child. We ensure abuse and neglect doesn&rsquo;t continue at the hand&rsquo;s of the court. A CASA forges a connection with the child/children they are matched with. They build their trust and discover what their needs are. Once a month they visit with their assigned child. Advocates examine the child's health and education records and meet with their caregivers, school, therapists and other professionals. Once they identify what the child&rsquo;s needs are, they write a report and advocate for a child&rsquo;s needs in court. Our staff and peer coordinators are with you every step of the way to support you and help you succeed. No special skills or specific backgrounds are needed.

Come participate in a 10-week leadership program and build your leadership, communication and project management skills. Project Coordinators (PC's), volunteer in a leadership capacity at our volunteer opportunities and provide organization and a team atmosphere for every volunteer experience. Project Coordinators (or PCs) provide leadership in Jersey Cares&rsquo; recurring volunteer opportunities by serving as a liaison between volunteers, nonprofit partners, and Jersey Cares. They encourage volunteers to \\\"Be the Change\\\" and provide directions during projects. It&rsquo;s a fun learning opportunity where you get to network with nonprofits and other community leaders while being supported by a cohort of other volunteer leaders. Typically, Project Coordinators commit to 1+ projects per month for 6 months at a time, but the Seasons of Service Program is an accelerated course in a sense. Instead of 6 months, Seasons of Service Project Coordinators take on 10 weeks (though you may certainly continue as a Project Coordinator after that time), and have a chance to work more intimately with their peers; discussions and team-building are encouraged during Seasons of Service.

You can share the responsibility with another, but it must be intense and helpful for aspiring, hardworking students who come from underserved schools. THIS ASK IS TO ASSIST CURRENT 8TH GRADE STUDENTS, they need assistance urgently. Hours - At Grand Army Library - anytime between 9 am and 6 pm on Saturdays and 1-5 pm on Sundays. We can find other times and other locations. Children come from central Brooklyn (Crown Heights, etc) Background - We also have an initiative with Seeds in the Middle to give every child a chance to learn the academic skills to gain entry into New York City's top high schools - starting as early as 3rd or 4th grade. Why? Despite increasing funding and initiatives, the percentage of African-American and Latino students in NYC is far below their numbers in the NYC population. See the article here - showing in 2017 that only 10 percent of the seats offered went to minority students. https://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2017/03/08/only-10-percent-of-offers-at-new-york-citys-specialized-high-schools-went-to-black-and-hispanic-students/ Who are we? Seeds in the Middle has been working with students, faculties and parents and the community in central Brooklyn since 2010. We have seen the challenges and want to work closely with people who care to give children real chances to get the same access to top colleges as those in more affluent communities. We think we have an innovative solution to helping students achieve so they can have an equal shot at these schools - including competitive schools like LaGuardia High School of Performing Arts or Midwood or Murrow or any other school recognized as top by the most competitive colleges. That's you! Help us create a new pathway for students! Empower real change. THIS FALL - Volunteers are asked to commit at least two hours a week and hopefully 8 or more hours a week until the test which will be held in October or early November. ATTENTION - beyond this fall test, if you want to tutor younger ages or do anything further, read below For the long-term plan, WE ask for commitments of at least three months, or you can work for years with a student on special skills. You must: sign that commitment when you finish your term, explain to the next tutor what you are working on with the student confer with our certified educators for guidance so you know exactly what they need to work on. STUDENTS - WE CAN GIVE COMMUNITY SERVICE HOURS FOR THIS. Locations? May vary - it might be Brooklyn Central Library near Grand Army Plaza or a school in Brownsville, Flatbush or Crown Heights, Brooklyn or maybe right at Stuyvesant High School or one of the top high schools. If you have a location near a train, let us know. Who are the students you will tutor? Each student must write a letter or essay, saying why he or she wants to go to a top high school and signing, with a parent, their commitment to coming every week for as long as it takes. We are starting at 3rd or 4th grade, and offer this to students through 8th grade. We hope to launch this on MLK weekend 2018 - so respond right away. PS - We would like to ask every volunteer to donate $50 or anything to help support our efforts. If you just want to tutor and cannot give, that is okay. But this is an unfunded program, so we are asking for donations to pay the people who are creating and organizing these opportunities and to administer this. All donations are tax-deductible. If you are willing to fundraise at all - even a bake sale - for our efforts, we would truly appreciate. Our goal is $20,000 and we want to offer tutors to as many children who want it - can be 100 or more... you can see what we do at seedsinthemiddle.org and on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/seedsinthemiddle/ What is our goal? To get at least 20 students into any of these schools, maybe more. But our initial goal is to ensure at least 20 students get the education necessary to pass the specialized high school test or other tests to go to the school of their choice - who - WITHOUT YOU - would never get a chance to get in. More info? Email - info@seedsinthemiddle.org Please write us and tell us: Who you are Days you are available What is your commitment - how many weeks at 2 x a week Where are you willing to travel? Will you go to Brownsville or central library? Why you want to do this? If you are a high school student, please offer, if you can, a school advisor to vouch for you Can you help us fundraise at all?", "title": "Tutor! Urgent!

This can serve 58,064,516,129 meals using the national average amount spent on a meal, $2.79. In order to address this issue of waster, Rescuing Leftover Cuisine helps bring food from our partners to a local homeless shelter. It takes less than an hour and you can set your own schedule, whether you want to help out daily, weekly, or sporadically. Our events at Rescuing Leftover Cuisine typically last 30 minutes (Some events are longer, some are shorter). On each event, we rescue an average of 50 pounds of food, which feeds about 40 people. It only take 30 minutes to help feed over 40 people! WHAT WE'LL BE DOING: Help rescue some prepared food and drinks from a restaurant in the Financial District! We will deliver the food to the NYC Rescue Mission, located at 90 Lafayette St, New York NY 10013 Mediumweight: the average amount of food rescued from this event is 20-40 pounds. WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW: This event meets rain or shine, so please dress appropriately! WHERE TO MEET: 67 Wall Street, New York, NY 10005 1133 Broadway, New York, NY 10010 RESCUING LEFTOVER CUISINE: Rescuing Leftover Cuisine is a national 501(c)3 non-profit food rescue organization, operating in 16 cities and headquartered in New York City, that provides solutions to prevent excess wholesome cuisine from being wasted. RLC provides services such as food waste consulting, excess food delivery, co-branding services, and tax credit assistance. RLC approaches the two large issues of hunger and food waste in three main ways. First, we localize the issues into sets of communities that can help sustain themselves. We crowdsource the solution of the transportation to the members of the public in these communities as volunteers. After identifying the homeless shelters of a needy community, we proactively find restaurants, hotels, and catering companies with excess food in that vicinity that could help support these disadvantaged communities. Second, we leverage technology to facilitate the identification and handling of excess food. Thus, partner food providers report when excess food is occurring and a web application is used to engage community members, because volunteering with us can be as easy as taking a brisk walk. Third, we tackle food waste at its root, aiming to eliminate as much food waste as possible and bringing the remaining excess food to where it is needed most. The data of when food waste occurs is used in our analysis of what types of food waste could be avoided, and RLC suggests ways that partner food providers can reduce waste at its root.", "title": "Volunteer with One Brick and Rescuing Leftover Cuisine", "zipcode": "10013", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D3020298%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "ONE BRICK"}, {"end": "2018-11-30", "description": "The Autoimmune Registry is looking for passionate volunteers to provide on-site assistance with event space set-up, catering arrangements, greeting guests, distributing give-aways, and other responsibilities as needed for our fundraising event on November 27th 2018.

The continuity of RBP offers a child the opportunity to not only improve their reading skills and open up their imagination, but more importantly it gives them the chance to deepen the bonds and their sense of trust with one person. As their friendships with the children evolve, volunteers can better help the children in this program to see their world in a more positive light.

In 1998, the Children&rsquo;s Defense Fund reported that violent crime by young people ages 10-17 peaks between 3 and 7 PM; children and teens in poor neighborhoods are struggling for direction and positive opportunities are needed to keep them safe and on-track; a great majority of all American fourth graders cannot read or do math at grade level, including more than five of six black children. In addition, a study published in Pediatrics magazine found that eighth graders who were left alone after school reported greater use of cigarettes, marijuana, and alcohol than those in adult-supervised settings. Current research indicates that supervised after-school and summer programs not only keep children safe and out of trouble, they also significantly improve their academic achievement. PROJECT DESCRIPTION Teaching high-risk, inner-city Youth the skills to become successful in life is at the core of the ACN SUMMER YOUTH CAPACITY BUILDING program. The Four(4) major components of the program are: *Homework Assistance through tutoring, mentoring and Use of Computer labs. *Nutrition Education to promote healthy lifestyles and Combat Obesity. *Life Skills which are integrated throughout all phases of the program. *Soccer Instructions where participants engage in fun physical fitness, enjoy the camaraderie of playing in a soccer team format with friends and peers, and learn to become responsible adolescents and adults. The summer After-School Program- will serve approximately 600 children which includes academic tutoring five(5) hours per week and Soccer Instruction, Health and life skills education ten(10) hours per week. Participants will receive Soccer Instruction in professional settings and practice skills in team format play. They will learn about the rules of the game, etiquette, sportsmanship, positive attitudes, fair play, self-esteem, taking responsibility for choices and management of emotions. These life skills are integrated throughout the Soccer program, and instructors routinely demonstrate how they apply to situations in all aspects of life. Nutrition and Healthy lifestyles are stressed both in the Classroom setting and on the Soccer Field. Healthy Snacks will be provided. The ACN YOUTH CAPACITY BUILDING program is Fortunate to have a corpse of Volunteers willing to dedicate to the program and are available to work with the children on improving their academic skills. Seeking Volunteers from some of the community based Universities/colleges who will take an active role in the homework area, working individually with the students using current homework assignments. In the computer lab, Volunteer tutors will help the students improve their keyboarding skills and show them how to use the computer for research.
