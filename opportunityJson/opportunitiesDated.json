Here is a description of the course: This course aims to provide students with practical tools and applied knowledge on how best to find a fulfilling job in today&rsquo;s, increasingly competitive, job market. It is divided in four parts, or modules. The first deals with vocation; that is, establishing what career path(s) best fit your talents, values and aspirations. The second aims at establishing what kind of experience you need to best achieve your career goals, both in terms of academic study and extra-curricular activities. The third concerns the networking and information-gathering skills you will need, both online and in person, to find the right job opportunities for you. Finally, the last and largest module deals with self-presentation and interviewing techniques, with specific training and evaluation sessions on r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and cover-letter writing as well as job interview strategy and performance. As an applied and participatory course, classes will involve a variety of pedagogical exercises in addition to lectures by the instructor and a number of invited guests from the business world.

WE NEED TUTORS RIGHT NOW to start supporting underserved children so they can build skills to do well on standardized tests and for entry into competitive, quality middle and high schools. Every weekend and free time you can give, let us know. We will assign you a child and you must be dedicated to that student at least three months. You can share the responsibility with another, but it must be intense and helpful for aspiring, hardworking students who come from underserved schools. Hours - At Grand Army Library - anytime between 9 am and 6 pm on Saturdays and 1-5 pm on Sundays. We can find other times and other locations. Children come from central Brooklyn (Crown Heights, etc) Background - We have an initiative with Seeds in the Middle to give every child a chance to learn the academic skills to gain entry into New York City's top high schools - starting as early as 3rd or 4th grade. Why? Despite increasing funding and initiatives, the percentage of African-American and Latino students in NYC is far below their numbers in the NYC population. See the article here - showing in 2017 that only 10 percent of the seats offered went to minority students. https://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2017/03/08/only-10-percent-of-offers-at-new-york-citys-specialized-high-schools-went-to-black-and-hispanic-students/ Who are we? Seeds in the Middle has been working with students, faculties and parents and the community in central Brooklyn since 2010. We have seen the challenges and want to work closely with people who care to give children real chances to get the same access to top colleges as those in more affluent communities. We think we have an innovative solution to helping students achieve so they can have an equal shot at these schools - including competitive schools like LaGuardia High School of Performing Arts or Midwood or Murrow or any other school recognized as top by the most competitive colleges. That's you! Help us create a new pathway for students! Empower real change. THIS FALL - Volunteers who can help prepare students for the Specialized High School test are asked to commit at least two hours a week end until the test which will be held in October or early November. ATTENTION - beyond this fall test, if you want to tutor younger ages or do anything further, read below For the long-term plan, WE ask for commitments of at least three months, or you can work for years with a student on special skills. You must: sign that commitment when you finish your term, explain to the next tutor what you are working on with the student confer with our certified educators for guidance so you know exactly what they need to work on. STUDENTS - WE CAN GIVE COMMUNITY SERVICE HOURS FOR THIS. Locations? May vary - it might be Brooklyn Central Library near Grand Army Plaza or a school in Brownsville, Flatbush or Crown Heights, Brooklyn or maybe right at Stuyvesant High School or one of the top high schools. If you have a location near a train, let us know. Who are the students you will tutor? Each student must write a letter or essay, saying why he or she wants to go to a top high school and signing, with a parent, their commitment to coming every week for as long as it takes. We are starting at 3rd or 4th grade, and offer this to students through 8th grade. We hope to launch this on MLK weekend 2018 - so respond right away. PS - We would like to ask every volunteer to donate $50 or anything to help support our efforts. If you just want to tutor and cannot give, that is okay. But this is an unfunded program, so we are asking for donations to pay the people who are creating and organizing these opportunities and to administer this. All donations are tax-deductible. If you are willing to fundraise at all - even a bake sale - for our efforts, we would truly appreciate. Our goal is $20,000 and we want to offer tutors to as many children who want it - can be 100 or more... you can see what we do at seedsinthemiddle.org and on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/seedsinthemiddle/ What is our goal? To get at least 20 students into any of these schools, maybe more. But our initial goal is to ensure at least 20 students get the education necessary to pass the specialized high school test or other tests to go to the school of their choice - who - WITHOUT YOU - would never get a chance to get in. More info? Email - info@seedsinthemiddle.org Please write us and tell us: Who you are Days you are available What is your commitment - how many weeks at 2 x a week Where are you willing to travel? Will you go to Brownsville or central library? Why you want to do this?

It takes less than an hour and you can set your own schedule, whether you want to help out daily, weekly, or sporadically. Our events at Rescuing Leftover Cuisine typically last 30 minutes (Some events are longer, some are shorter). On each event, we rescue an average of 50 pounds of food, which feeds about 40 people. It only take 30 minutes to help feed over 40 people! WHAT WE'LL BE DOING: Help rescue some prepared food and drinks from a restaurant in the Financial District!

RLC provides services such as food waste consulting, excess food delivery, co-branding services, and tax credit assistance. RLC approaches the two large issues of hunger and food waste in three main ways. First, we localize the issues into sets of communities that can help sustain themselves. We crowdsource the solution of the transportation to the members of the public in these communities as volunteers. After identifying the homeless shelters of a needy community, we proactively find restaurants, hotels, and catering companies with excess food in that vicinity that could help support these disadvantaged communities. Second, we leverage technology to facilitate the identification and handling of excess food. Thus, partner food providers report when excess food is occurring and a web application is used to engage community members, because volunteering with us can be as easy as taking a brisk walk. Third, we tackle food waste at its root, aiming to eliminate as much food waste as possible and bringing the remaining excess food to where it is needed most. The data of when food waste occurs is used in our analysis of what types of food waste could be avoided, and RLC suggests ways that partner food providers can reduce waste at its root.", "title": "Volunteer with One Brick and Rescuing Leftover Cuisine", "zipcode": "10013", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D3020298%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "ONE BRICK"}, {"end": "2018-11-30", "description": "The Autoimmune Registry is looking for passionate volunteers to provide on-site assistance with event space set-up, catering arrangements, greeting guests, distributing give-aways, and other responsibilities as needed for our fundraising event on November 27th 2018.
