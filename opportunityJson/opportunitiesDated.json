In addition to our healthcare staff, we have a Wellness team overseen by a mental health professional. There is one child specialist assigned to each age group to assist counselors and staff members in managing any challenges associated with living in a new environment. The entire camp staff volunteer their time and energy to provide this incredible one-week experience for our youth. While we understand the difficulty in fully disengaging from the outside world, we expect volunteers to be present and engaged at all times to help create a fun, loving and safe environment for both staff and campers. Volunteers are given two nights off after campers have gone to bed and one period off each day to take a nap, grab a coffee or call home. Besides daily lessons in dance, drama, sports, arts & crafts, spoken word and more, we have a slew of special events.
