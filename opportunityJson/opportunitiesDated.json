Camp AmeriKids is a one-week free summer camp for youth ages 8-16 who are infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS and/or sickle cell disease. We work with youth who might not normally be able to attend camp because of medical concerns and provide them with a traditional summer camp experience - all free of charge. We have a comprehensive medical team living at camp, available 24/7, which allows youth living with sickle cell, HIV/AIDS and other chronic illnesses to have a great time at camp while their families can be assured their health and well-being are monitored. In addition to our healthcare staff, we have a Wellness team overseen by a mental health professional. There is one child specialist assigned to each age group to assist counselors and staff members in managing any challenges associated with living in a new environment. The entire camp staff volunteer their time and energy to provide this incredible one-week experience for our youth. While we understand the difficulty in fully disengaging from the outside world, we expect volunteers to be present and engaged at all times to help create a fun, loving and safe environment for both staff and campers. Volunteers are given two nights off after campers have gone to bed and one period off each day to take a nap, grab a coffee or call home. Besides daily lessons in dance, drama, sports, arts & crafts, spoken word and more, we have a slew of special events. These include an evening luau, day at the carnival, a talent show and of course - campfires and s&rsquo;mores! Given the responsibilities involved in caring for children and the unique nature of our program, we take every precaution and screen all applicants extensively to ensure a good match. All volunteers are provided with housing and meals for the week. Mandatory orientation on Saturday, August 3 rd will acquaint you with camp and fellow volunteers to prepare before the campers arrive. Descriptions for cabin counselors, program and operations staff and preferred qualifications are below. To apply, please fill out a Volunteer Application online. For more information, email Executive Director Chloe Ettari at cettari@elm-project.org. CABIN COUNSELORS A team of counselors is responsible for the 24-hour supervision of a cabin and maintains a 2:1 camper to counselor ratio. The cabin counselor&rsquo;s enthusiastic participation in all aspects of camp is crucial in creating a memorable experience for our campers. We expect counselors to be completely engaged and participate in the fun alongside the kids - whether that&rsquo;s hopping in the pool, trying a new sport, or dancing on stage! Counselors are expected to be leaders and role models, as well as sources of energy and ideas. They are a key part of the Camp AmeriKids community. Qualifications Experience working with children Excellent team player and leadership skills Strong interpersonal and communications skills Flexible, energetic and creative (having skills or talents to teach campers is a plus!) Comfortable multi-tasking and working in a fast-paced, changing work environment Ability to relate well to people from diverse backgrounds and maintain confidentiality Ability to maintain a positive attitude under stress Passion for our mission and desire to work with children in a camp setting Program Staff Every summer we welcome a phenomenal crew of talented artists, performers and teachers from around the world to share their skills and experiences with our campers. Program staff facilitate learning and fun for campers in their area of expertise (i.e. dance, arts & crafts, sports). Each day, cabins will visit different program areas and participate in 45-minute activity periods. We expect program staff to come prepared with activities for campers of various age groups to learn and participate in - and be flexible when the schedule changes! In addition, we offer older campers (ages 12-16) the opportunity to choose a dedicated program area to attend every afternoon and work on a \\\"weekly project\\\" with a larger group. Campers will showcase their work on the last evening at our Talent Show - i.e. performing a short play, reciting original poetry, singing a song, or performing a choreographed group dance. Qualifications Personal or professional experience in at least one of the following areas: dance, theatre, arts & crafts, music, spoken word/poetry, sports, nature or film. If you have skills or talents not listed, we encourage you to apply and let us know what new program area you can teach!

Young people have interests, passions, and the desire to deeply engage in their own learning and development. GripTape makes this possible by giving youth decision-making control over what and how they learn, small grants to pursue a topic they're passionate about, and a Champion to encourage them along the way. That's where YOU come in! Here's what former Champion, Laura Johnson, shared about her experience: \\\"If you&rsquo;d like to meet some fascinating people, then I recommend being a GripTape Champion. The youth I&rsquo;ve encountered, both current and past Challengers, are kind, engaging, and much smarter than I am.........It&rsquo;s been refreshing to be part of their journeys, which has been a journey of my own. I&rsquo;ve learned that someone else&rsquo;s energy and talent can be inspirational. I&rsquo;ve learned there&rsquo;s a gift that costs nothing but means everything - saying to someone, 'I believe in you.'\\\" This opportunity is perfect for: College students seeking volunteer hours Professionals within the education/youth-development space Adults who have a deep, genuine interest in the learning experiences of young people Still unsure?
