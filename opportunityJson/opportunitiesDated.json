About the Event We will be hosting a Movies for Mental Health (M4MH) workshop on Monday April 23 at Molloy University, from 7:00 to 9:00 pm (volunteers arrive at 6:00pm). Our M4MH workshop is a 2-hour interactive workshop on college campuses that creates space for students to have open and honest conversations about mental health. They involve interactive discussion, watching and responding to short films about different mental health issues, and a panel of speakers talking about lived experience stories, and mental health resources available to students on-campus and in the community. The workshops are incredibly powerful, eye-opening, and inspiring, as it&rsquo;s not often that we get to truly talk about these complex issues. The vast majority of students who attend report that the workshop increased awareness of mental health issues, reduced stigma around mental illness, and increased their likelihood to seek mental health support if they need it. Workshop Support Volunteers Our Workshop Support Volunteers (that&rsquo;s you!) are an incredibly important aspect of our work. The workshop will be led by one of our facilitators, and they can&rsquo;t do it alone! They will be setting up and leading the workshop, and there are a lot of moving parts involved. Your tasks as a Workshop Support Volunteer could include: Having a phone call with AWI&rsquo;s Program Director to discuss the details of volunteering, and to learn more about AWI and the M4MH workshop Checking in with the AWI Workshop Facilitator a few days prior to the event to go over the day-of details Arriving at the workshop one hour before the event starts Assisting with the setup of the AWI table of resources Passing out and collecting pre- and post-workshop surveys Typing into the Powerpoint while the facilitator is running the workshop Taking photos throughout the workshop After the workshop, representing AWI at the resource table, chatting with students about AWI, and helping with any logistical clean-up before leaving the event If there are multiple volunteers, you will not need to do all of these tasks, so don&rsquo;t worry if there&rsquo;s anything in that list that you wouldn&rsquo;t want to do.

Organization Description: The National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) and Be The Match (BTM) is the global leader in providing marrow, PBSC, and umbilical cord blood transplants to patients with leukemia, lymphoma, and other diseases. The nonprofit organization matches patients with donors, educates health care professionals, supports patients and their families, and conducts research so more lives can be saved. Be The Match Walk+Run Overview: Be The Match Walk+Run is a fundraising event that helps patients with blood cancers like leukemia find a marrow donor and receive a life-saving transplant. Every four minutes someone is diagnosed with a blood cancer. It can happen to anyone at any time. But so can a cure - a marrow transplant. The cure for blood cancer is in the hands of ordinary people. Most of us won&rsquo;t have a marrow donor in our family and Be The Match matches volunteer marrow donors with patients who need them. The Be The Match Walk+Run (5K, 1K, and Tot Trot) raises funds to: add more volunteer potential marrow donors to the Be The Match Registry, giving more patients hope for a cure; help patients with uninsured treatment costs; and support continued marrow transplant research.", "title": "Be The Match Walk+Run Service Intern: New York City", "zipcode": "10044", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D2373047%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "Be The Match"}, {"end": "2018-05-19", "description": "The National Ovarian Cancer Coalition is holding its first New York City Run/Walk To Break the Silence on Ovarian Cancer on Saturday, May 19th on Roosevelt Island!

Students are challenged to break into teams, select from a group of random items and create their own lesson plans for a specific age group. The following week, each team visits a local shelter partnered with our organization and they host a 1-hour literacy program with the children in the shelter program. The program finishes off with a lesson in identifying literacy challenges in our own communities among our peers and is followed up with a subsequent literacy day for the community. The literacy day is planned by the students and all games are created or reinvented by the students. They invite their collective communities, family, and friends out to the event where students are awarded and recognized for their work. Lesson plans, activities, and supplies are provided to the instructor. The group will meet on Thursdays April-May.

As a volunteer you can feed the hungry at soup kitchens and food pantries or by delivering meals to homebound elderly. You can visit the sick as a Hospice volunteer or nursing home friendly visitor. RSVP volunteers also help by tutoring children who are having difficulty learning to read, and by preparing adults and recent immigrants for the high school equivalency exam or to find employment. Some volunteers help by providing administrative support at local non-profit organizations, while others assist local museums and cultural institutions as docents.
