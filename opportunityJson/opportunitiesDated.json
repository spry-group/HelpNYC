Coaches are expected to commit to: At least one night a week (3 hours) of direct tutoring and mentoring with a group of 5-7 high school students This site runs on Tuesdays and Thursdays - all volunteers pick one night a week to serve. 1.5 hours a week to prepare for each week&rsquo;s lesson and to communicate with students about homework questions, attendance reminders, and other support. Let&rsquo;s Get Ready provides training and ongoing support for all of its Coaches. Initial training is based around the SAT, its structure, and how to effectively engage a classroom of high school students. Secondary trainings are conducted by Let&rsquo;s Get Ready Site Directors and focus on how to improve and give Coaches a chance to highlight some aspects of their role that are going really well. Throughout programming, Let&rsquo;s Get Ready staff supports Coaches with a variety of resources and professional development opportunities as well as in-person observations and feedback.

Have fun, play ball, make a difference. Attn, Students! Yes, we give community service credits. Recommendation letters given. Our program started in 2009 just to get kids active.

SCHEDULE - July 14 - Nov. 23, 2019 Special Open Fieldand Try-outs - early September INFO: No coaching experience needed. Just love of the game and able to collaborate with others. Of course, we'd love it if you have experience... Practices are co-ed, and players range from 3 to 12 years old and are at beginner to intermediate level. If we have enough players, will create boys and girls only teams for ages 10 and up.. If you're self-motivated, love kids and are good with them, can handle the unexpected, and just love this game and want to share it, you're for us. Looking for reliable and flexible players who can commit to at least 2 practices. This is a great community service opportunity for high school and college students.

Breaking down will include clearing tables, boxing event materials, cataloging remaining auction items, and other tasks as directed. About The Cristian Rivera Foundation On January 22, 2007, I received the worst news of my life. My 4 year-old son, Cristian, was diagnosed with an inoperable Pontine Glioma brain stem tumor which generally affects kids 1 to 9 years-old. It has no cure and it also has a life expectancy of 3 to 18 months. Cristian&rsquo;s battle for his life lasted 2 years and a few days (passing away on January 25, 2009) but the new battle in honor of his new life has begun. Cristian, I love and miss you dearly. Ever since you passed away, I committed myself to help find a cure for this deadly disease so that no other family would have to go through the grief of losing their beloved children. In keeping with this commitment, I have created the Cristian Rivera Foundation in your honor. Mission Statement The Cristian Rivera Foundation is a non-profit organization that is committed to finding a cure for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG). Our foundation strives to increase public awareness of DIPG, as well as raise funds that will provide financial support to families and medical facilities that conduct innovative research and clinical trials. Through its many efforts, the Cristian Rivera Foundation has helped build the foundation that supports the groundbreaking research that will one-day cure DIPG. The Cristian Rivera Foundation funds the work of Dr. Mark Souweidane, Director of Pediatric Neurosurgery of Weill Cornell Medical Center - Memorial Sloane (Kettering) Cancer Center and Dr. Oren Becher of Ann & Robert H.

About The Cristian Rivera Foundation On January 22, 2007, I received the worst news of my life. My 4 year-old son, Cristian, was diagnosed with an inoperable Pontine Glioma brain stem tumor which generally affects kids 1 to 9 years-old. It has no cure and it also has a life expectancy of 3 to 18 months. Cristian&rsquo;s battle for his life lasted 2 years and a few days (passing away on January 25, 2009) but the new battle in honor of his new life has begun. Cristian, I love and miss you dearly. Ever since you passed away, I committed myself to help find a cure for this deadly disease so that no other family would have to go through the grief of losing their beloved children. In keeping with this commitment, I have created the Cristian Rivera Foundation in your honor. Mission Statement The Cristian Rivera Foundation is a non-profit organization that is committed to finding a cure for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG). Our foundation strives to increase public awareness of DIPG, as well as raise funds that will provide financial support to families and medical facilities that conduct innovative research and clinical trials. Through its many efforts, the Cristian Rivera Foundation has helped build the foundation that supports the groundbreaking research that will one-day cure DIPG. The Cristian Rivera Foundation funds the work of Dr. Mark Souweidane, Director of Pediatric Neurosurgery of Weill Cornell Medical Center - Memorial Sloane (Kettering) Cancer Center and Dr. Oren Becher of Ann & Robert H.

What is nXu? nXu is a non-profit organization and an innovative youth purpose incubator that offers programming to help high school students explore, articulate, and pursue their purpose in life. This fall, nXu is launching a selective, 1-year, out-of-school fellowship program in San Antonio, Seattle, and New York City. The program brings together ~30 10th graders from a range of district, charter, private and parochial schools to form an intentionally diverse cohort that bridges race, gender, and class lines. During the school year, nXu Fellows gather twice per month for immersive sessions led by our Lead Compass Coach and a team of volunteer Compass Coaches. What is the volunteer opportunity? We are looking for passionate volunteer Compass Coaches who are excited to lead 10th grade nXu Fellows through this year-long Purpose Exploration journey. Using our curriculum, each volunteer Compass Coach will guide their Compass Team (~8 participants) through a series of pre-scripted and planned immersive activities, conversations, exercises, and reflections. With support from Compass Coaches, Fellows will form valuable bonds and expand their self-knowledge. We are looking for volunteer Compass Coaches who: Represent a range of identity markers and professional experiences. Show an interest in exploring their own self-development. Are eager to share their personal and professional wisdom and experiences. Are intellectually curious, vulnerable, and ready to have a good time. Are excited to be trained in providing an inclusive and engaging experience for students. Demonstrate excellent interpersonal and communication skills and are capable of delivering pre-scripted content. Want to guide nXu participants to reach their desired life purpose goals and help them reflect on various experiences. What is the time commitment? We ask that volunteer Compass Coaches attend: A training session-dates will be scheduled based on volunteer Compass Coach availability. The All-Day Launch Retreat from 9:00 AM - 9:00 PM. All subsequent 13 sessions. (See our website for dates and times). We are open to volunteers who may not be able to make every single session. What else should I know? nXu will set you up for success. Our team will ensure that volunteer Compass Coaches are positioned for success by providing thorough training in orientation and continuous coaching throughout the Fellowship volunteer experience. Volunteer Compass Coaches will receive pre-scripted session plans in order to successfully execute our curriculum. nXu sessions are designed so that everyone who participates-including Compass Coaches-has the opportunity to learn from our curriculum. During each immersive session, the Lead Compass Coach (head facilitator) will set the tone and orient the nXu Fellows to the day&rsquo;s learning objectives. With support from the Lead Compass Coach, volunteer Compass Coaches will guide the nXu Fellows through the day and support them in learning the session&rsquo;s objective through a series of engaging activities/practices, reflections, and authentic conversations. Volunteer Compass Coaches will build a culture of curiosity and vulnerability, ask questions, lead discussions, share their own experiences, and actively engage in the day&rsquo;s activities with the Fellows. Compass Coaches will walk away from each session having contributed to the development of the Fellows, while also learning something new about themselves. What if I want to volunteer with nXu but don&rsquo;t have the time to commit to being a volunteer Compass Coach? No worries! We are open to volunteers who may not be able to make every single session. You can also fill out the volunteer form (see below) and select that you&rsquo;re interested in ad hoc volunteer activities. We&rsquo;ll have more volunteer opportunities come up.
