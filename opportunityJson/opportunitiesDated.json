ABOUT PKD Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is one of the most common, life-threatening genetic diseases affecting thousands in America and millions worldwide. There is no treatment or cure.

For most patients, their PKD ultimately causes the kidneys to shut down. Once that happens, dialysis and transplant are their only options to prolong life. Parents with the dominant form of PKD have a 50% chance of passing the disease on to each of their children. For the recessive form, ARPKD, parents have usually never heard of PKD until their newborn is diagnosed with it. For 30% of newborns, ARPKD is fatal.

Health Equity Initiative (HEI) is a 501(c)3 member-driven nonprofit membership organization dedicated to building and sustaining a global community that engages across sectors and disciplines to advance health equity. The organization provides its members and broader community with the knowledge, skills and innovative approaches to tackle health inequities, helps them build capacity within their own organizations and communities, and facilitates opportunities for multi-sectoral and multidisciplinary collaboration in support of health equity. HEI also offers professional development and networking opportunities through lectures, webinars, and training programs. Since its inception, Health Equity Initiative has been devoted to the development of innovative solutions to address the social determinants of health - the conditions in places where people live, work, and play, which can affect their health, functioning and quality of life. Health Equity Initiative is at an inflection point in its growth trajectory. As an organization that functions primarily through a volunteer core - an acting Executive Director who provides her time in-kind, an active board, and a group of committed volunteers-augmented by a limited part-time and project-specific freelance staff, HEI has managed to accomplish a significant amount and maintained momentum in developing cross-sectoral programming, capacity training and education and information exchanges for a burgeoning health equity movement. But we recognize that the timing is right to seek funding to strengthen our organization&rsquo;s structure and build its capacity. This would allow us to extend our capabilities and be responsive to the increased urgency that currently exists in recognizing and addressing social determinants of health (SDOH). [SDOH are defined as the social, economic, and physical conditions in the environments where people live, work, and play that can affect their health, functioning and quality-of-life outcomes.] There is a growing understanding amongst funders as well as within community-based organizations, health systems, public health entities, and municipal and private planning agencies, that creating a culture of health and developing positive health outcomes that are measurable requires an understanding of the social determinants of health in each community as well as to support greater health equity by combatting the negative effective of certain social determinants [i.e. poverty, limited transportation, lack of access to healthy food, unclean air or water, unsafe housing, unemployment, lack of cultural competence in clinical settings, low health and media literacy, etc.] and removing barriers to improved health and social outcomes. Health Equity Initiative, as a thought leader in the field that represents multiple entities dedicated to health equity, is well positioned to taking a leading role in the much-needed campaign to recognize the role of SDOH and to bring together multi-sectoral stakeholders to create health equity. We have 4 openings on our board of directors. We are looking for passionate, energetic and motivated Board members who have experience with fundraising for social causes, have a network that spans sectors, and experience connecting subject matters experts with philanthropists. Although a minimal financial contribution of $5,000 is expected, equally important is a willingness to take an active role in developing the organization through the donation of time, fundraising skills, and energy. N.B. While in-person board meetings occur in New York City, many meetings take place virtually (conference call or GotoMeeting).

More on the course: The mission of The Pablove Foundation is to invest in under-funded, cutting-edge pediatric cancer research, inspire cancer families through education, and improve the lives of children living with cancer through the arts. Pablove Shutterbugs, a program of The Pablove Foundation, teaches children living with cancer to develop their creative voice through the art of photography. In an educational setting, the five-week program instructs children to tell their story through photographs using perspective, light, composition, and technique. Our Shutterbugs are taught basic principles of photography while learning on digital point-and-shoot cameras provided by Pablove, and reflect on their work. The cameras are theirs to keep at the end of the course.", "title": "MANDARIN INTERPRETER NEEDED IN NEW YORK FOR CANCER PATIENT IN PHOTOGRAPHY CLASS", "zipcode": "10019", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D3014352%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "The Pablove Foundation"}, {"end": "2019-10-20", "description": "The National MS Society is looking for support with Volunteer Check-In at Bike MS: New York City!
