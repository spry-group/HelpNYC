Camp AmeriKids is a one-week free summer camp for youth ages 8-16 who are infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS and/or sickle cell disease. We work with youth who might not normally be able to attend camp because of medical concerns and provide them with a traditional summer camp experience - all free of charge. We have a comprehensive medical team living at camp, available 24/7, which allows youth living with sickle cell, HIV/AIDS and other chronic illnesses to have a great time at camp while their families can be assured their health and well-being are monitored. In addition to our healthcare staff, we have a Wellness team overseen by a mental health professional. There is one child specialist assigned to each age group to assist counselors and staff members in managing any challenges associated with living in a new environment. The entire camp staff volunteer their time and energy to provide this incredible one-week experience for our youth. While we understand the difficulty in fully disengaging from the outside world, we expect volunteers to be present and engaged at all times to help create a fun, loving and safe environment for both staff and campers. Volunteers are given two nights off after campers have gone to bed and one period off each day to take a nap, grab a coffee or call home. Besides daily lessons in dance, drama, sports, arts & crafts, spoken word and more, we have a slew of special events. These include an evening luau, day at the carnival, a talent show and of course - campfires and s&rsquo;mores! Given the responsibilities involved in caring for children and the unique nature of our program, we take every precaution and screen all applicants extensively to ensure a good match. All volunteers are provided with housing and meals for the week. Mandatory orientation on Saturday, August 3 rd will acquaint you with camp and fellow volunteers to prepare before the campers arrive. Descriptions for cabin counselors, program and operations staff and preferred qualifications are below. To apply, please fill out a Volunteer Application online. For more information, email Executive Director Chloe Ettari at cettari@elm-project.org. CABIN COUNSELORS A team of counselors is responsible for the 24-hour supervision of a cabin and maintains a 2:1 camper to counselor ratio. The cabin counselor&rsquo;s enthusiastic participation in all aspects of camp is crucial in creating a memorable experience for our campers. We expect counselors to be completely engaged and participate in the fun alongside the kids - whether that&rsquo;s hopping in the pool, trying a new sport, or dancing on stage! Counselors are expected to be leaders and role models, as well as sources of energy and ideas. They are a key part of the Camp AmeriKids community. Qualifications Experience working with children Excellent team player and leadership skills Strong interpersonal and communications skills Flexible, energetic and creative (having skills or talents to teach campers is a plus!)

Program staff facilitate learning and fun for campers in their area of expertise (i.e. dance, arts & crafts, sports). Each day, cabins will visit different program areas and participate in 45-minute activity periods. We expect program staff to come prepared with activities for campers of various age groups to learn and participate in - and be flexible when the schedule changes! In addition, we offer older campers (ages 12-16) the opportunity to choose a dedicated program area to attend every afternoon and work on a \\\"weekly project\\\" with a larger group. Campers will showcase their work on the last evening at our Talent Show - i.e. performing a short play, reciting original poetry, singing a song, or performing a choreographed group dance. Qualifications Personal or professional experience in at least one of the following areas: dance, theatre, arts & crafts, music, spoken word/poetry, sports, nature or film. If you have skills or talents not listed, we encourage you to apply and let us know what new program area you can teach!

This can serve 58,064,516,129 meals using the national average amount spent on a meal, $2.79. In order to address this issue of waster, Rescuing Leftover Cuisine helps bring food from our partners to a local homeless shelter. It takes less than an hour and you can set your own schedule, whether you want to help out daily, weekly, or sporadically. Our events at Rescuing Leftover Cuisine typically last 30 minutes (Some events are longer, some are shorter). On each event, we rescue an average of 50 pounds of food, which feeds about 40 people. It only take 30 minutes to help feed over 40 people! WHAT WE'LL BE DOING: Help rescue some prepared food and drinks from a restaurant in Midtown West! Heavyweight: the average amount of food rescued from this event is enough for a group of around five or so people. WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW: Please be aware volunteers should be able to carry a bag of food for a 15 to 30 minute walk. This event happens rain or shine. WHERE TO MEET: Please meet inside the Two Forks restaurant RESCUING LEFTOVER CUISINE: Rescuing Leftover Cuisine is a national 501(c)3 non-profit food rescue organization, operating in 16 cities and headquartered in New York City, that provides solutions to prevent excess wholesome cuisine from being wasted. RLC provides services such as food waste consulting, excess food delivery, co-branding services, and tax credit assistance. RLC approaches the two large issues of hunger and food waste in three main ways. First, we localize the issues into sets of communities that can help sustain themselves. We crowdsource the solution of the transportation to the members of the public in these communities as volunteers. After identifying the homeless shelters of a needy community, we proactively find restaurants, hotels, and catering companies with excess food in that vicinity that could help support these disadvantaged communities. Second, we leverage technology to facilitate the identification and handling of excess food. Thus, partner food providers report when excess food is occurring and a web application is used to engage community members, because volunteering with us can be as easy as taking a brisk walk. Third, we tackle food waste at its root, aiming to eliminate as much food waste as possible and bringing the remaining excess food to where it is needed most. The data of when food waste occurs is used in our analysis of what types of food waste could be avoided, and RLC suggests ways that partner food providers can reduce waste at its root.", "title": "Volunteer with One Brick and Rescuing Leftover Cuisine to prevent food waste", "zipcode": "10018", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D3158303%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "ONE BRICK"}, {"end": "2019-06-29", "description": "We are looking for a caring and committed individual to help us create a \\\"promotional\\\" video of our hip-hop majorette and step teams that serve approximately 25 girls (ages K to 12).
