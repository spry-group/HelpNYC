ABOUT PKD Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is one of the most common, life-threatening genetic diseases affecting thousands in America and millions worldwide. There is no treatment or cure. You can help bring a treatment within reach. Polycystic Kidney Disease causes fluid filled cysts to form on both kidneys. Over time, these cysts grow and multiply, sometimes dramatically in size. For most patients, their PKD ultimately causes the kidneys to shut down. Once that happens, dialysis and transplant are their only options to prolong life. Parents with the dominant form of PKD have a 50% chance of passing the disease on to each of their children. For the recessive form, ARPKD, parents have usually never heard of PKD until their newborn is diagnosed with it. For 30% of newborns, ARPKD is fatal.

In 1998, the Children&rsquo;s Defense Fund reported that violent crime by young people ages 10-17 peaks between 3 and 7 PM; children and teens in poor neighborhoods are struggling for direction and positive opportunities are needed to keep them safe and on-track; a great majority of all American fourth graders cannot read or do math at grade level, including more than five of six black children. In addition, a study published in Pediatrics magazine found that eighth graders who were left alone after school reported greater use of cigarettes, marijuana, and alcohol than those in adult-supervised settings. Current research indicates that supervised after-school and summer programs not only keep children safe and out of trouble, they also significantly improve their academic achievement. PROJECT DESCRIPTION Teaching high-risk, inner-city Youth the skills to become successful in life is at the core of the ACN SUMMER YOUTH CAPACITY BUILDING program. The Four(4) major components of the program are: *Homework Assistance through tutoring, mentoring and Use of Computer labs. *Nutrition Education to promote healthy lifestyles and Combat Obesity. *Life Skills which are integrated throughout all phases of the program. *Soccer Instructions where participants engage in fun physical fitness, enjoy the camaraderie of playing in a soccer team format with friends and peers, and learn to become responsible adolescents and adults. The summer After-School Program- will serve approximately 600 children which includes academic tutoring five(5) hours per week and Soccer Instruction, Health and life skills education ten(10) hours per week. Participants will receive Soccer Instruction in professional settings and practice skills in team format play. They will learn about the rules of the game, etiquette, sportsmanship, positive attitudes, fair play, self-esteem, taking responsibility for choices and management of emotions. These life skills are integrated throughout the Soccer program, and instructors routinely demonstrate how they apply to situations in all aspects of life. Nutrition and Healthy lifestyles are stressed both in the Classroom setting and on the Soccer Field. Healthy Snacks will be provided. The ACN YOUTH CAPACITY BUILDING program is Fortunate to have a corpse of Volunteers willing to dedicate to the program and are available to work with the children on improving their academic skills. Seeking Volunteers from some of the community based Universities/colleges who will take an active role in the homework area, working individually with the students using current homework assignments. In the computer lab, Volunteer tutors will help the students improve their keyboarding skills and show them how to use the computer for research. They will read aloud with the students and give quizzes on tapes and videos to improve comprehension. When the college/university students volunteers are not on campus, volunteers from local Churches will assume the role of tutors. Incentives will be awarded to the participants based on attendance, good behavior and general attitude.", "title": "ACN YOUTH CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT", "zipcode": "10460", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D2923783%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "Africa Compassion Network"}], "10305": [{"end": "2018-08-09", "description": "Thursday, August 9th|Staten Island|6:00pm-9:00pm Help us celebrate the summer at Geller House, a residence for children, with an evening of fun activities and snacks provided by the Staten Island community.", "title": "Summer fun at Geller House!", "zipcode": "10305", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D2981847%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services"}], "10301": [{"end": "2019-08-01", "description": "We are an agency that serves homebound older adults.

About Artistic Noise: Mission and Purpose Artistic Noise exists to bring the freedom and power of artistic practice to young people who are incarcerated, on probation, or otherwise involved in the justice system. Through visual arts and entrepreneurship programs in Massachusetts and New York, our youth artists give voice to their experiences, build community through collaborative projects, and learn valuable life and job skills. Artistic Noise creates safe spaces where court-involved youth can be seen, heard and supported on their path to adulthood. We believe the practice of making art offers opportunities for young people and communities to transform. About our Programs By working with youth both in state custody and back in the community, Artistic Noise provides continuity for young people who are often experiencing trauma and upheaval in their lives. Our staff of teaching artists and licensed art therapists works with our participants to create safe, challenging spaces for creative expression. Using a variety of artistic mediums, youth explore themes such as friendship, loss, sexual violence, community, freedom, identity and their dreams for the future. This structured artmaking fosters critical thinking and problem solving skills that are beneficial to the teens' healthy psychological development. https://www.artisticnoise.org/ How to apply: Please submit your resume/cover letter to tamara.scarlett@artisticnoise.com and/or Amanda.holm@artisticnoise.com", "title": "Artistic Noise seeks new member for Board of Directors", "zipcode": "10027", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D2289467%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "ARTISTIC NOISE INC"}, {"end": "2018-12-19", "description": "Market Access Program Intern Start Small Think Big (Start Small) is a not-for-profit organization located in Harlem.
