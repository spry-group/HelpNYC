Family Court Judges assign CASA to assist with the most complex cases. To learn more, visit www.casa-nyc.org. Duties: Volunteer Advocates conduct thorough research on the background of the case, reviewing documents and interviewing all parties involved. They report to the court, raising issues of concern that may interfere with a child's best interests and providing information that will help the judge make an informed decision. Volunteer Advocates can also play a pivotal role in assuring that a child or family is receiving services the court has ordered, such as physical or mental health services, substance abuse counseling or special education. During the life of a case, Volunteer Advocates monitor the child's situation to assure he or she remains safe and may be the only constant in the child's life as he or she moves through the bureaucratic maze of the child welfare system. Volunteers come from all backgrounds and need not have experience in legal or social services. The only requirement is a strong desire to help children who are in dire need of help. A note on volunteer commitment: Volunteer Advocates complete a one-time 30-hour core training and commit to serve for a minimum of one year after case assignment or until an assigned case is closed. In addition to dedicating at least 3-5 hours, more if necessary, each week on each case assigned, volunteers attend monthly group supervisions and in-service trainings.
