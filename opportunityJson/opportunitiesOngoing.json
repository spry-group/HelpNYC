Guiding Principles As a board member, I understand that I owe duties of care, loyalty, and obedience to the organization and the children it serves. The duty of care is the duty to monitor Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s activities, see that its mission is being accomplished, and guard its financial resources. The duty of loyalty is the duty to avoid conflicts of interest. The duty of obedience is to be faithful to Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s mission and to comply with the law. I will uphold these duties and do my utmost to ensure that Maya&rsquo;s Hope performs its mission and achieves its goals. Principal Commitments Act with integrity and represent the interests of all people served by the organization. Recognize that decisions of the board can be made only by a majority vote at a) a board meeting or b) in writing. Respect the majority decisions of the board. Participate in: Board self-evaluation programs. Board development workshops, seminars, and other educational events that enhance skills as a board member. Handle information with discretion and confidentiality as necessary. Exercise authority as a board member only when acting in a meeting with the full board or as delegated by the board with members. Collaborate with members who serve this board and leave personal prejudices out of all board discussions. Represent Maya&rsquo;s Hope in a positive and supportive manner at all times. Display courteous conduct at all board and committee meetings. Refrain from intruding on administrative issues that are the responsibility of management, except to monitor the results of the organization. Monitor the financial condition of the organization. Understand and comply with the bylaws of Maya&rsquo;s Hope. Avoid conflicts of interest between my position as a board member and my personal or professional life (as referenced in Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s Conflict of Interest Policy.) If such a conflict does arise, I will disclose that conflict to the board and refrain from voting on matters in which I have conflict. Liability of Board Members As a fully incorporated non-profit, Maya&rsquo;s Hope enjoys the same limited liability that any corporation does. Corporations offer the protection of limited liability to corporate directors and officers. Limited liability means that the organization's directors and officers have limited personal liability for business debts. Generally, creditors can only go after corporate assets and insurance to satisfy liabilities incurred by the corporation. This principle applies, however, only when the board has fulfilled its basic duties, such as the duty of care. A board member is legally bound to exercise reasonable care when he or she makes a decision for the organization. Reasonable care is what an 'ordinarily prudent' person in a similar situation would do. Examples of when a board member may have personal liability include (but are not limited to) when a board member: personally and directly injures someone. personally guarantees a bank loan or a business debt on which the corporation defaults, or behaves in a fraudulent or illegal manner that causes harm, Maya&rsquo;s Hope maintains a Directors & Officers liability insurance policy. Responsibilities of Secretary: Meeting Minutes The primary task of the secretary of an executive board is to record and maintain the minutes of each board meeting. Meeting minutes are detail reports that highlight the predetermined agenda of each conference as well as what actually took place. For example, a secretary may notate the following: \\\"The meeting began at 11 a.m. The first order of business was for the president to discuss potential changes to the organization&rsquo;s mission statement; however, he was unable to attend the gathering due to medical reasons. The issue was put on hold until a later date.\\\" Record Maintenance As the custodian of corporate records, the secretary of an executive board must maintain all company files in a manner compliant with organizational policies as well as any laws that regulate the industry. These documents may include the firm&rsquo;s article of incorporation, bylaws and employee contact lists, as well as financial records. He must also develop and enforce policies regarding access to these confidential files. Security controls, such as who can access which files and what approvals are needed to do so, are examples of the many procedures he must implement. Depending on the industry in which the company does business, the secretary of the executive board may be required to file certain documents with the government. For example, a nonprofit organization must meet certain criteria to maintain its tax-exempt status. It is often the responsibility of the secretary to ensure that all necessary paperwork is completed and returned to the Internal Revenue Service. Organizational Representative It is not uncommon for the secretary of an executive board to serve as its signing officer. This designation gives her the authority to sign documents, such as contracts, checks and credit applications, on behalf of the organization. Because this responsibility wields so much power, many firms implement a system of checks and balances so it is not abused. For instance, before signing a service agreement, the secretary may need the express written permission of two other board members. She must follow these guidelines or risk termination and, in severe cases, criminal prosecution.", "title": "Board Member Opening at Maya's Hope", "zipcode": "10001", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D2862432%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "Maya's Hope"}, {"end": null, "description": "Marketing & Communications Director Tasks involved in position Lead the Marketing and Communications Chair to direct the overall comprehensive marketing and communications strategy.

The Petition Colleges and universities could save students billions of dollars a year on textbooks by adopting these policies. We call on them to: Consider the cost when selecting textbooks. Use free Open Source textbooks whenever possible. Do not require university-specific editions or (unless essential) the latest edition, which undermine the used book market. Refrain from requiring students to purchase expensive access codes for homework assignments and quizzes.

A pioneering nonprofit, Heifer International, has shown that nonprofits can capture some of that money by making donations, given in a friend&rsquo;s name, feel like a present. It works! They raise $115 million a year this way. Imagine how much more gift money could be captured by nonprofits addressing popular causes, including your favorites. The challenge is that it is too daunting for most nonprofits to provide a gift-like experience: tangible donation opportunities, wish lists, gift registries, and personalized printed greeting cards. About www.ChangingThePresent.org Our nonprofit site provides a gift-like experience, which helps 400 leading nonprofits capture money normally spent on traditional presents. The NY Times called it an \\\"amazon.com of the nonprofit world.\\\" We are now about to invite all million nonprofits to join the site. We are also providing each with their own private, charitable gift sites so they can send supporters without exposing them to other nonprofits. See a sample: http://SampleNGO.GiftsForHumanity.org.

This is an outstanding leadership opportunity in an innovative start-up nonprofit organization. About ClassWish ClassWish is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in NYC and working nationwide. Our initial focus was in providing resources for K-12 students. We are now turning attention to help generate funds for nonprofits and for college tuition and textbooks, as well. We offer high-achieving students unparalleled opportunities to assume responsibility, use their skills, gain experience, and make a difference--and provide relief from the cost of college tuition and textbooks. Here are the problems we are tackling: We are tackling two problems at once: Nonprofits need far more funding to fulfill their missions, and schools need far more resources for kids (books, computers, art supplies, musical instruments, science equipment, and sports equipment are all in desperately short supply). Students and their families are burdened by the skyrocketing cost of college tuition and textbooks. (By the way, be sure to see www.TuitionRevolution.org). Our Approach ClassWish is launching a new initiative to address these needs. Soon, students and their families will be able to earn an average of 8% of what they spend at stores, grocers, gas stations, restaurants, hotels, and airlines, and they will be able to direct that to their favorite schools, teachers, nonprofits, or even their own tuition and textbooks. What Campus Reps Will Do ClassWish Campus Reps will help raise awareness of this opportunity for students, professors, and their families to generate funding for schools, nonprofits, and college tuition. We will recruit a campus rep on each college campus.

They will also appear on web banner ads that we design specifically for each of them. We will secure donated ad inventory from fashion magazines, websites, blogs, schools, and retailers. The ClassWish PSA ads will feature the celebrities involved in the program. We will build Cause Marketing and promotional campaigns with fashion brands and retailers. For instance, we are working on one campaign now: 'Win a wardrobe for yourself and one for your favorite teacher.&rsquo; We will seek editorial coverage of the campaign from fashion magazines and websites. We will use social media to reinforce these campaigns. We are a small organization, so we seek outstanding students who can take a leadership role.

Here is the problem we are tackling: K-12 schools in this country do not have enough resources to let children explore their potential and excel. Books, computers, art supplies, musical instruments, science equipment, sports equipment, and even paper for computers and printers are all in desperately short supply. Our Approach: ClassWish . org , an exciting new nonprofit, uses modern business practices and the latest marketing techniques to help 125,000 schools serving 56 million kids, inform, inspire and engage supporters. Teachers visit the site to create Wish Lists of the resources they need. People in the community can see exactly what is needed and contribute to help.

Yo-Yo Ma, Tony Hawk and Dwight Howard are among the celebrities who have offered to help promote ClassWish.org. Most importantly, current and former interns will offer a great review of ClassWish.org. The Work: Teachers and students are already getting supplies from ClassWish.org. Now, we need to raise greater awareness and encourage more participation so we can help more kids. Campus Reps will promote various campaigns at their colleges. The first to launch is a micro-philanthropy program, which you can read about at http://ThankTheTeachers.org . College students are writing notes to former K-12 teachers to thank them for their support and to let them know of ClassWish.org, at the same time. This is a great way for teachers to learn of the opportunity to get needed resources, and it is a quick and easy way for college students to make a difference. Imagine how many teachers we could reach if even 25% of the students at your college each took just a couple of minutes to write to former teachers. Campus Reps will promote Thank The Teachers on their campus, using a combination of direct outreach, social media, and other communications tools. The Environment: This is, frankly, a great place to work. We get great interns from all over the country and all over the world, so the atmosphere is energetic, creative, and fun.

ClassWish is a nonprofit, but we use the latest techniques from the business world to make a leveraged, scalable and financially-self sustaining difference in the lives of tens of millions of children.

We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your rsum, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions.

We are looking for passionate, energetic students with exceptional skills to help promote ClassWish.org through high-profile social media campaigns. This is an outstanding leadership opportunity in an innovative start-up nonprofit organization. Here is the problem we are tackling: K-12 schools in this country do not have enough resources to let children explore their potential and excel. Books, computers, art supplies, musical instruments, science equipment, sports equipment, and even paper for computers and printers are all in desperately short supply. About Us: The people behind ClassWish.org include such prominent education and business leaders as Adam Hirsch, former COO, Mashable; Laurie Coots, CMO, TBWA; Scott Cutler, EVP, New York Stock Exchange; Betsy Morgan, former CEO, Huffington Post; Nancy Pelz-Paget, Director, Education and Society Program, Aspen Institute; Sharon Robinson, CEO, American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education.

Forbes Magazine liked our approach so much that they donated a full page to help raise awareness. Yo-Yo Ma, Tony Hawk and Dwight Howard are among the celebrities who have offered to help promote ClassWish.org. The work: Teachers and students are already getting supplies from ClassWish.org. Now, we need to raise awareness among teachers, parents, donors and kids so we can make a bigger impact. Your social media skills will make that happen. You will take a leadership role and work with other highly motivated interns, established professionals, and directly with our co-founder. What do we offer? You will enhance your resume with a solid record of professional achievement and community service, and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you have helped children get the tools they need to perform at their best. If you want to gain great experience and do something you will always be proud of, send a cover letter and a resume to interns @ ClassWish . org. Impress us. This is competitive. FAQ Is this a business or a nonprofit? ClassWish is a nonprofit, but we use the latest techniques from the business world to make a leveraged, scalable and financially-self sustaining difference in the lives of tens of millions of children. This sounds ambitious! Daniel Burnham, the great Chicago architect, said \\\"Make no little plans; they have not the power to stir men&rsquo;s souls.\\\" (Nor women&rsquo;s, we hasten to add). Little plans also do not have the power to provide a better education to 56 million kids who deserve more than they are getting today. We face a crushing need in schools, have a solid plan to address it, and with your help, we intend to grow this very large and very fast. Where are you located? We are in Manhattan, conveniently located right across from Madison Square Garden. There are four express subway stops within one block. We will also hire interns to work remotely from other cities. I looked at your site and have some suggestions. Great! This is a collaborative project, and we want to hear from you. Is this a paid internship? We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your r\u00e9sum\u00e9, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions. When will you select the interns? We&rsquo;re agile. When we see a great candidate, we extend an invitation immediately. We won&rsquo;t keep you waiting for a decision. What dates will the internship run? We are hiring for the spring semester, for the summer, and beyond. Tell us what you are looking for. What are the hours? We welcome full-time and part-time interns. Let us know what works for you. What will I need to bring?

RSVP for our Information Session for Video Professionals! (See RSVP details below!) Our goal is to put together a volunteer team that can edit the groundbreaking work being done at The Actors Theatre Workshop. Using your professional skills to edit this wonderful material will surely stimulate hope, excitement and I believe bring true enlightenment to those who participate. At the same time you will reach another dimension in your craft as you learn about the unique filming/editing perspective of the ATW Founder and Artistic Director, Thurman E. Scott. ATW has long been on the front lines of disciplined creative training for theater professionals and individuals committed to fulfilling their creative potential. ATW has also been a safe haven for thousands of at-risk and homeless youth. The original theater and educational technique which has been tremendously successful with our professional acting students, has proven to be equally beneficial to the children we teach in our after-school programs. We have many years of footage from our adult acting workshop's and community program's that we want to share with you and the world. We've started sharing this video online and we've received such positive feedback from every corner of the globe that we are taking steps to put out more. This process takes time and so we would like to find more dedicated individuals who want to learn and make a difference in other people's lives and be a part of something hopeful by joining our video editing team. Our editors often talk about the beautiful, inspiring and deeply moving moments they have witnessed when a student actor or a child from a homeless shelter brings forth his talent and reaches for their potential. You literally see the moments when there is a shift in consciousness and they begin to accept their strength and the unique gifts that they have to offer the world. And in that moment you know that this person has changed forever-- and as a result undoubtedly so have you. By working directly with this material you will gain deep insight into the emotional and psychological breakdown of drama, and learn to see the penetrating insights that come out of script analysis, which gives you the ability to find and understand the eternal essence of ideas that are then formulated into a universal idea that helps to instill faith and spread hope to all individuals on a creative journey. So without further ado.. We invite you to a Volunteer Info Session for video editing professionals .To RSVP go to: http://www.actorstheatreworkshop.com, click on \\\"volunteers\\\" and fill out an online application.

This is an intensive Leadership Training Program in non-profit business management. Interns receive hands-on training as a management assistant. If skilled in video, interns may assist in video production and editing at our award-winning theater arts and community service organization. As video production becomes increasingly critical to the growth, development and success of managing a successful non-profit, we seek intern candidates that are leaders who are passionate about non-profit management and posses skills in video production and editing. Successful non-profits are built on powerful ideas that inspire hope. These ideas are manifested in the programs and the management of the organization. By gaining a working understanding of how to successfully manage a nonprofit organization, the intern begins to learn its core principals, which allows the intern to begin to take a leadership role in the organization. In addition, this knowledge is invaluable in the creation of videos that effectively promote and bring this work to the world. These videos are essential to the marketing and fund-raising efforts in any successful non-profit. We are looking for individuals with the ability to lead, manage teams, work independently, communicate effectively on the phone, in person and in writing and interact in a fast-paced business environment. We are looking for idealists and leaders who can put their thoughts and insights into action; positive, enthusiastic individuals who want to make a difference in the world and are committed to upholding the legacy and tradition of theater in the belief that theater can change a life and make the world a better place for everyone. The interns' primary responsibility is to manage the daily administrative operations of the organization and to take a leadership role in programming initiatives. There will be opportunities to work closely with the senior staff: in administrating over workshops for actors and community programs that serve Youth-at-Risk and homeless children. Under ATW supervision, interns will be accountable for projects in the management of ATW's studio rental business, administration, team management, marketing, development, sales, fund-raising, video production, event planning, and graphic design.

In addition, Interns may also work on a combination of logging, editing, and production of on-going video projects that depend on ATW's current schedule and on the intern's skill level. Interns will work under the direction of a project manager. We seek applicants with training and experience logging footage, editing in Final Cut Pro, http streaming, digital shooting, lighting, sound and web design and development. Interns and Volunteers consistently report they gain tremendously from filming and reviewing footage of ATW classes and workshops and have benefited as if they had actually taken the classes themselves. In summary, we seek professional, detail-oriented individuals who are positive and curious, with a desire to learn and engage in a process. The Actors Theatre Workshop is an award-winning non-profit theater, educational institution and community center in NYC founded by award-winning actor, director, writer and producer, Thurman E.

BRC helps these neediest New Yorkers overcome the challenges of addiction, physical and mental illness, and poverty, and improves life in the community. Outreach is BRC's program for homeless individuals living on the streets and in other unstable situations. It is the most extensive outreach program in New York City covering specific Manhattan based locations, i.e. Grand Central Station, Penn Station and Port Authority Bus Terminal, 5 days per week in vans and on foot. Outreach staff and volunteers engages homeless individuals with the goal of assessing each individual's situation and needs and providing each client with an accessible doorway to services they need. Clients are afforded referral, transportation and placement at the resource deemed most beneficial to the individual, and each is treated with respect, professionalism and informed guidance. The Outreach Team encounters many individuals that are reluctant to use services or have found the available resources unmanageable and overwhelming. These clients are provided with counseling, information and advocacy in pursuing services, rights and resources. Every individual engaged is given the opportunity to access the services most suited to their needs. Working with Outreach staff, volunteers will help refer clients to assessment shelters, drop-in centers, drug and alcohol treatment, psychiatric and medical facilities, job training centers and entitlement offices. Normally a staff-only position, volunteers are needed to help us continue in our Outreach efforts. All teams will be midtown Manhattan based specifically at the Port Authority Bus Terminal on either Wednesday of Thursday evenings from 7pm to 9:30pm.

Volunteer Kenya / ICODEI is a non-religious, non-political volunteer organization run through a partnership of past overseas volunteers and local Kenyans. Our Microenterprise Development Program is our newest program. We have been active in helping set up small income-generating activities (IGA) for rural self-help groups since the early 2000's (primarily thru grants), but only recently began focusing our work on providing more advice, consulting assistance, and small loans to the groups. MDP volunteers work with the existing microenterprise groups to help them grow and improve their existing projects, as well as help newly forming groups start an IGA. The 5 main areas of volunteer activity in the MDP are as follows: \u2022 Progress Assessment \u2022 Facilitate a Group Project Discussion / Evaluation and Provide Project Advice \u2022 Facilitate Knowledge and Resource Sharing Within the Network of Groups \u2022 Provide Small Loans \u2022 Provide General Business Skills Training Seminars Most volunteers spend their time doing a combination of all the above 5 items. Our value-added is not just in the form of providing financial resources (loans) but includes project planning advice, basic management and accounting training, and (very importantly) volunteers act as facilitators between our vast network of groups in order to facilitate knowledge and resource sharing among the groups. Our pilot microlending program has just gotten off the ground during the last several months and we currently have about $10,000 USD in outstanding loans. The MDP volunteers will be spending a lot of their time over the next several months meeting with the loans groups to ensure that are on schedule with paying back their loans and that they are investing their money prudently (e.g., in productivity enhancing resources versus consumption items). As the loans are repaid, the volunteers then give them out in the form of new loans to other groups. We have a very large backlog of loan application requests. As a volunteer in the MDP you would spend the vast majority of your time out in the field meeting and working with the women microenterprise groups, which is a very rewarding and educational experience. All of the microenterprise groups within our network are independent groups. We do not manage their day to day operations and do not charge any type of fee for our services. We are a strict volunteer non-for-profit organization. All interest that we receive from the microloans goes towards new loans for additional groups. We are now have a network of around 100 microenterprise groups within the western Kenya region. As of June 2007, our organization has had over 350 volunteers since 1998 from over 6 different countries. Volunteers in our Microenterprise Development have come from a variety of backgrounds including undergrad business students (Duke, Rice, Miami, Indiana), MBA and graduate students on their summer break (Stanford, Penn, etc.), management consultants (BCG, McKinsey, CRA), retired professionals, and accountants.

Organization Description: The National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) and Be The Match (BTM) is the global leader in providing marrow, PBSC, and umbilical cord blood transplants to patients with leukemia, lymphoma, and other diseases. The nonprofit organization matches patients with donors, educates health care professionals, supports patients and their families, and conducts research so more lives can be saved. Be The Match Walk+Run Overview: Be The Match Walk+Run is a fundraising event that helps patients with blood cancers like leukemia find a marrow donor and receive a life-saving transplant. Every four minutes someone is diagnosed with a blood cancer. It can happen to anyone at any time. But so can a cure - a marrow transplant. The cure for blood cancer is in the hands of ordinary people. Most of us won&rsquo;t have a marrow donor in our family and Be The Match matches volunteer marrow donors with patients who need them. The Be The Match Walk+Run (5K, 1K, and Tot Trot) raises funds to: add more volunteer potential marrow donors to the Be The Match Registry, giving more patients hope for a cure; help patients with uninsured treatment costs; and support continued marrow transplant research.", "title": "Be The Match Walk+Run Service Intern: New York City", "zipcode": "10044", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D2373047%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "Be The Match"}, {"end": null, "description": "We are seeking a volunteer for our Friendly Visiting Program to visit a woman who lives on Roosevelt Island.

In our TechFests, we introduce to students a STEM topic: Coding an App, Engineering a Circuit, Maker Space topic, or a Science concept. We then teach them the basics of this topic, and then they practice it before making an actual product using the concepts they learned. Your job is to support the instructor (unless you step up to be the instructor, and this has happened on occasion) and to support the students in using the concepts they may be learning for the first time to build a product. You may not be well versed in the STEM concept, but not to worry - there will be some training and orientation beforehand, and we have found that usually it's being there to support the student, along with your own critical thinking and reasoning, you both will be able to figure it out together. We do not introduce extremely complicated STEM concepts (such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Java) unless we will have a number of those masters in the room. The STEM concepts we teach are applicable for early learners of STEM, where the barriers to accessing the content is low. We do offer challenging concepts, but they are taught in ways that will reduce stress and frustration, as it's our aim to have the students walking away from the session feeling great about their accomplishments, as well as having learned something new. We also want YOU to have a great experience! The TechFests on the 1st and 2nd Saturdays will be on the campus of Columbia University. These students will be ages 8-12. The time will be 8:30-12:30.

Sprout is a non-profit organization based in New York City focused on providing innovative programs for adults with developmental disabilities.With our network of resources and dedicated volunteers, which we call leaders, Sprout opens up fascinating new worlds to people with disabilities. Sprout's Overnight Vacations Program is looking for individuals who have the energy, motivation and desire to work with adults with developmental disabilities. What do Sprout leaders do? Sprout leaders' primary goal is to give adults with developmental disabilities the opportunity to experience and enjoy recreational, educational and leisure activities through overnight vacations. Leaders are responsible for the overall safety and enjoyment of their group, 24 hours a day, while on a Sprout trip. Duties include safety monitoring, personal hygiene assistance, providing physical and emotional support, activity planning, budgeting, logistics, and enhancing fun. The work is hard yet immensely rewarding as you develop leadership skills and gain insight into your own abilities. What type of training is provided? Leaders must complete a pre-service training, which provides the necessary procedures and tools to run a successful and enjoyable vacation. Leaders who are drivers receive extra training on how to safely drive our 15-passenger vans. In addition, all leaders receive a copy of Sprout's Leadership Handbook to help with policies and guidelines. What is the time commitment? Sprout vacations last 3 - 7 days depending on the time of year and destination of the trip. When a leader is selected for an overnight vacation, Sprout asks that the leader dedicate themselves to stay with their group throughout the entire duration of the vacation. Some leaders only choose to lead one trip a year while others spend several months with us leading up to 8 trips or more. Sprout strives to make our program flexible for our leaders based on the amount of time leaders can give. Do leaders have any free or personal time while on a trip? Sprout trips are working vacations for the leaders who choose to participate. Because Sprout leaders are responsible for their group 24 hours a day, there is no free or personal time allotted. In order to give our participants the opportunity to experience and enjoy a vacation, Sprout leaders must be available at all times to provide the support any one participant may need. What type of trips can Sprout leaders expect to join? A majority of Sprout trips take place within a day's drive of New York City. Destinations include Atlantic City, Amish Country, Boston, Lake George, Cleveland, Maine and Virginia Beach. Exotic trips like cruises, Hawaii, and Europe are presented to leaders who have demonstrated high levels of commitment, service hours and have gained positive feedback from participants and Sprout office staff. Are there any special skills or requirements? No special background or education is required to become a Sprout leader. We encourage people from all cultures and professions, and of all ethnic and educational backgrounds. Once accepted into the program, you will receive the necessary tools to sign up for outings and how to assist our participants. Requirements include: -21+ years old -Provide references -Participate in training session -Willingness to complete necessary background checks -Evaluate participants' behavior -Fluent English -Willing to drive a 15 passenger van -Love to travel & have fun!

Got your attention! In late January/early February 2016, Community Tax Aid (CTA) will train volunteers to prepare tax forms (federal, state and local) for low income tax payers. Volunteers will then serve one morning, afternoon or evening per week at one of our sites. Our sites are in all boroughs except S.I. Services are provided from mid-Feb. to Mid-April. We are different from other free tax prep organizations in that our training when followed by volunteer tax prep time qualifies for CPE credit for CPA's - a definite benefit for the volunteer. Also, for tax payers we can file out of state and prior year forms, some forms not handled by VITA and other IRS free prep sites, and we also have people available year round if needed for follow-up tax info. Many of our clients have been with us for many years. Anyone who has experience filling out tax forms and feels comfortable doing them should be able to serve after training. Our volunteers come from all walks of life. Many of our sites are handicapped accessible. This opportunity is sponsored by: Community Tax Aid, Inc. We need volunteers who are free at these times: Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday evenings 6-9 PM or Saturdays 10-1 or 1-4PM or Sundays 12-3 PM This volunteer opportunity is available to the following types of volunteers: adults, especially those with tax experience, lawyers, accountants and accounting students.

Also, the idea that we should always be mindful of our health, from when we are very young to our elderly years.

You'll get communications from the transport coordinator and, once the transport is a \\\"go\\\", you simply drive to the meeting place, load up the animals, and drive them to the next meeting place to hand them off to the next volunteer. You'll get plenty of doggy kisses and thank you's along the way as the animals know you are there to help them.

Volunteer Kenya - ICODEI is a non-religious, non-political volunteer organization run through a partnership of past overseas volunteers and local Kenyans. Our Microenterprise Development Program is our newest program. We have been active in helping set up small income-generating activities (IGA) for rural self-help groups since the early 2000's (primarily thru grants), but only recently began focusing our work on providing more advice, consulting assistance, and small loans to the groups. MDP volunteers work with the existing microenterprise groups to help them grow and improve their existing projects, as well as help newly forming groups start an IGA. The 5 main areas of volunteer activity in the MDP are as follows: \u2022 Progress Assessment \u2022 Facilitate a Group Project Discussion / Evaluation and Provide Project Advice \u2022 Facilitate Knowledge and Resource Sharing Within the Network of Groups \u2022 Provide Small Loans \u2022 Provide General Business Skills Training Seminars Most volunteers spend their time doing a combination of all the above 5 items. Our value-added is not just in the form of providing financial resources (loans) but includes project planning advice, basic management and accounting training, and (very importantly) volunteers act as facilitators between our vast network of groups in order to facilitate knowledge and resource sharing among the groups. Our pilot microlending program has just gotten off the ground during the last several months and we currently have about $10,000 USD in outstanding loans. The MDP volunteers will be spending a lot of their time over the next several months meeting with the loans groups to ensure that are on schedule with paying back their loans and that they are investing their money prudently (e.g., in productivity enhancing resources versus consumption items). As the loans are repaid, the volunteers then give them out in the form of new loans to other groups. We have a very large backlog of loan application requests. As a volunteer in the MDP you would spend the vast majority of your time out in the field meeting and working with the women microenterprise groups, which is a very rewarding and educational experience. All of the microenterprise groups within our network are independent groups. We do not manage their day to day operations and do not charge any type of fee for our services. We are a strict volunteer non-for-profit organization. All interest that we receive from the microloans goes towards new loans for additional groups. We are now have a network of around 100 microenterprise groups within the western Kenya region. As of June 2007, our organization has had over 350 volunteers since 1998 from over 6 different countries. Volunteers in our Microenterprise Development have come from a variety of backgrounds including undergrad business students (Duke, Rice, Miami, Indiana), MBA and graduate students on their summer break (Stanford, Penn, etc.), management consultants (BCG, McKinsey, CRA), retired professionals, and accountants.

All tutors are also expected to complete a four session comprehensive, professional training regimen. 6 hours of live training, plus another hour and a half for orientation. This is a commitment of 7.5 hours of in person training, and 4 hours of supplemental training for a total of 11.5 hours of training over the course of the Fall semester. Training days will be determined based on your schedule and that of the Tutor Training Coordinators. CT's tutoring program has been successful in helping students gain access to support that they otherwise would not have received, given their limited time spent on campus. Having a tutor in the class early in the semester will allow us to employ strategies to reduce withdrawals and student failure rates. Your work with us would help the students&rsquo; overall subject area performance, and help us improve this educational support model, reaching more students and departments with comprehensive academic support.
