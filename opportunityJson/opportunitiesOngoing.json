About The City Tutors (CT) is a volunteer tutoring program and non-profit organization with a goal to provide meaningful opportunities for volunteers to build professional skills and share their knowledge while helping to enhance and expand academic support to students in underserved programs around NYC. The City Tutors offers tutoring support and career development initiatives across four of the five boroughs as well as delivering academic services to all areas within the CCNY umbrella. The City Tutors is currently partnered with the Eisele Research Group, a nanotechnology group based out of the Center for Discovery and Innovation at the City College of New York. As part of a recently awarded NSF grant to the Eisele Research Group, an outreach program was created to present scientific concepts to students and communities throughout the city. The overall goal of this project is to increase public understanding of nanotechnology, and how fundamental research in nanoscience can pave the way to new renewable energy technologies. Increased public knowledge and engagement is only possible when the information is clearly disseminated to the public regarding what kind of research is being done and how the research can contribute to our society. Unfortunately, communicating and promoting science beyond a scientific audience proves challenging, a task that researchers themselves are not trained for. This project then aims to be a part of that change. The Eisele Group is partnering with Bronx Lacrosse, a student retention and support program that uses lacrosse as a vehicle to empower students both in and outside the classroom. Originally starting at the Highbridge Green School, it has expanded to support other middle schools within the Bronx Community. The project entails the creation of intriguing, simple to understand science lessons and activities for a middle school audience as part of a pilot initiative. The goal is to produce a minimum of 10 lessons/activities for students that will contain elements of professional development, conceptualization, lesson planning, presentation, and post-presentation phases, with periodic elements of sample student testing and evaluation. Members of the lab will use these short lessons/activities when giving talks about their work, and the activities will be made available to high school and undergraduate instructors.

Here is an opportunity to help underprivileged children, to help under-served children, to help ALL children, and even to help adults who can't read. Have you ever wanted to be a part of an amazing convergence of forces that is about to change the way the whole world does something? Have you ever heard anyone talk about a problem and say, \\\"that problem is impossible to fix,\\\" or, \\\"that's the way it's always been; there's no changing it.\\\" Well, people say that about world hunger, world peace, and low literacy. Two years ago, the Barbara Bush Foundation and Dollar General sponsored the $7million XPrize for Adult Literacy to bring in teams from around the world to develop an app-based solution to the adult literacy crisis in America. The parameters of the contest were that teams had to build an app that would teach reading to illiterate and low literate adults without any assistance from another adult (an \\\"independent learning\\\" app). At the American Youth Literacy Foundation (dba Youth Lit and YouthLit.org), our focus has always been on children's literacy. We joined this competition but opted out after a year. However, during that year we learned a lot, and since engaging in that experience, we have seen the future potential for this new, digital approach to the reading crisis. In the past several months we have made major progress on our own \\\"independent learning,\\\" smartphone app for children's literacy. Today we are further along than ever in the creation of this amazing new learning tool that teaches children how to read with little to no intervention required by a grown-up or older sibling or a tutor. The app is a digital representation of our patented reading curriculum that we have been using nationwide, for the past 10 years, the same curriculum we've been training tutors in, who, in turn, have taught thousands of children how to read. But now we need volunteers like you to help us put the prototype of the app in the hands of kids who are learning how to read so they can play with it and provide critical feedback that will help us finish the app and make it available to kids everywhere for FREE downloading from the Apple store and Google play. We believe that this app could literally solve the literacy crisis in America. If you have an interest in being a reading mentor to a child and want to help with this project, if you like working with kids, if you want to help them learn how to read, if literacy is something that you feel passionate about, and if finding a lasting solution to the literacy crisis is something you want to get involved in, then please reply today. We need your help. Thank you! We truly look forward to hearing from you : ) Please include a short note telling us about your interest in literacy. We will provide you with a letter explaining our tutoring program and more about this opportunity.

Volunteer Opportunities: Companionship Volunteers work directly with patients providing companionship, offering friendly visits, reading to patients, writing letters, offering a gentle touch or sharing a quiet moment. Complementary Volunteers are certified/trained professionals who can provide complementary modalities of reflexology, music, imagery and touch therapies such as Reiki, massage, therapeutic touch and healing hands. Pet Therapy Volunteers provide certified/trained pets who visit with patients. These animals provide loving memories for some and give unconditional love helping our patients feel connected to a larger world. Administrative Volunteers provide help to the staff in our Edison office by assisting with typing, addressing cards, organizing newsletters, creating packets, collating manuals and other varied clerical duties Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, huggable dolls/bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Junior Volunteers consist of groups such as girl/boy scouts or young people who wish to honor our patients by making holiday cards, posters, wall hangings and memory books. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families and friends of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network.

Volunteers are an integral part of the hospice team. Volunteer Opportunities: Companionship Volunteers work directly with patients providing companionship, offering friendly visits, reading to patients, writing letters, offering a gentle touch or sharing a quiet moment. Complementary Volunteers are certified/trained professionals who can provide complementary modalities of reflexology, music, imagery and touch therapies such as Reiki, massage, therapeutic touch and healing hands. Pet Therapy Volunteers provide certified/trained pets who visit with patients. These animals provide loving memories for some and give gunconditional love helping our patients feel connected to a larger world. Administrative Volunteers provide help to the staff in our Edison office by assisting with typing, addressing cards, organizing newsletters, creating packets, collating manuals and other varied clerical duties Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, huggable dolls/bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Junior Volunteers consist of groups such as girl/boy scouts or young people who wish to honor our patients by making holiday cards, posters, wall hangings and memory books. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families and friends of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network. Hospice training classes are required for Companionship and Complementary Volunteers. They are free of charge and offered on an ongoing basis.

For the past 15 years, GOSO has served thousands of justice-involved young men in New York City as they reshape their futures and become positive forces in their communities. GOSO&rsquo;s work is based on a holistic approach of our Three E&rsquo;s: Education: Education is fundamental to our participants' success. Not only does GOSO encourage participants to earn their high school diploma or TASC (formerly GED) through our school program, but we also provide workshops and individual counseling designed to keep young men in school and encourage exploration of different education opportunities, including higher education. Employment: Meaningful work experience that builds skills and open doors is also crucial. Our two-week job readiness curriculum leads to our robust employment program, GOSOWorks, which connects participants with our city-wide network of 70+ employer partners. Emotional Well-Being: Our staff of experienced and knowledgeable licensed social workers provide emotional support to our participants, more than 50% of whom are living with mental health issues and need helpful resources. Through programming and supportive services administered by a staff of some of the hardest working and most positive individuals in NYC, our participants are able to build on their existing skills and develop new ones to use in their future career, education, and daily lives. GOSO also hosts Stand Against Violence East Harlem (SAVE), which is part of the nationwide Cure Violence initiative. SAVE&rsquo;s mission is to treat violence like an epidemic, and to prevent the spread of violence by stopping it at its source. SAVE's team of Outreach Workers and Violence Interrupters go out into the East Harlem community to detect and interrupt conflicts, treat high-risk individuals, and change the social and community norms.

Grace Healthcare Services is a Hospice Organization seeking volunteers to assist with our new Tuck-In program. What is a Tuck-in call? Volunteers make a phone call to patient/family 5-7 days after they were admitted to Hospice Services, to ensure the patient and families needs are being met. Volunteers follow a script with a few questions to ensure the needs are being met. For example, \\\"were the medications explained to you?\\\" \\\"Has the Social Worker, Nurse, and Chaplain been in contact with you?\\\" \\\"Do you have any recommendations to help us improve our services?\\\" A report is made to the clinical staff and if the patient/family needs anything, our team will address the concerns in a timely manner. The Tuck-in Program is our way of extending comfort and care when we are not in the home. For our volunteers it is a great way to make a positive difference in the lives of our patients and families. We offer flexible scheduling, and once trained, calls can be made from our office or from the comfort of your own home!

The Comprehensive Community Hospice Program of Parker Jewish Institute is looking for people who would like to volunteer as a doula, going out to patients' homes and extending the hand of reassurance, offering a smile that warms the heart, and the words that say everything will be okay. Volunteer Doulas will help patients and families cope with the process of dying, remaining at the bedside as life ends. \\\"Doula\\\" is a Greek word that means \\\"woman servant or caregiver.\\\" Today it is associated with individuals who provide physical assistance and emotional support during and/or after childbirth. This proposed program aims to mirror the concept by providing the same type of support at the final phase of a terminal illness. This initiative will place a focus on planning for death with the elderly patient and family if there is one, and will provide a continuous around the clock vigil as death becomes imminent. The program will help the elderly patient who lacks family or adequate caregiver support to die comfortably, without fear of being alone. Even when surrounded by loved ones, individuals with a terminal illness and those closest to them may feel isolated as they face the end of life. As the end of life approaches, patients and families struggle with anxiety and fear; exhaustion; loved ones often feel alone, unprepared and afraid; and opportunities to explore meaning go unaddressed. Hospice Doulas provide emotional support and comfort to patients and their loved ones in the final phase of a terminal illness. Our End-of-Life (EOL) Doula volunteers will receive thorough training in understanding the dying process and in the skills that help bring peace and comfort to all involved. This free two-day training includes learning how to do guided visualization, help create rituals, provide simple physical support, offer sacred presence, as well as how to create spiritual and emotional legacies. Parker Jewish institute will be hosting a free two-day Doula training workshop on Saturday 10/28/17 and Sunday 10/29/17 from 9:00am-6:00pm. Breakfast and lunch will be served. A certificate will be awarded upon completion of this workshop. If you are interested in attending, please call the Hospice Program's Volunteer Doula Coordinator at 718-289-2134, or email volunteer-nerken@parkerinstitute.org. Doulas can come from any background and no experience is required. They typically work in as part of a team. They usually sit quietly with a patient, talk with them and offer support, comfort and companionship.

Hospice volunteers are a special group of people that use their time and talents to enrich the quality of life for our patients and their families as the end of life approaches. Hospice volunteers enhance the quality of life and help reduce the burden for family caregivers by providing support, assistance, in patient&rsquo;s homes, in nursing homes, and assisted living facilities. To be a volunteer, there is no special requirement other than a sincere desire to help people and the ability to listen. The most important thing you can do is be there for patients to reassure them they are not alone. It is not an easy undertaking, but it can enrich your life well as patients and families. Hospice volunteers can commit to as little or as much time as they wish. Some volunteers provide several hours of service each week while others commit to a few hours each month. Serving as valued members of the hospice team, for just a few hours of your time you can make a significant impact on the lives of patients and their loved ones. There are many opportunities to share your time and talents as a volunteer and support patients, their loved ones dealing with end of life. Opportunities include: Hospice Doulas Bereavement/Grief Patient Friendly Visits Legacy Projects Administrative Support Community Education Help Recruiting Other Volunteers Note: We ask that those who have recently lost a loved one wait a year before becoming a hospice volunteer.

In this role, you would collaborate with an instructor to improve students&rsquo; performance while being supported and guided by an experienced academic support professional.

You would identify and support students who are struggling, moderate the online blog used to facilitate class discussion, and provide feedback to the instructor regarding students' concerns and difficulties that can lead to changes in future lessons. You might also design videos or assignments, and create differentiated instruction as the need arises. You will be supported throughout this process by the City Tutors staff. Tutors providing virtual support outside of the class also need to maintain a reliable internet connection in a relatively quiet space for a minimum of 1 hour sessions. All tutors are also expected to complete a four session comprehensive, professional training regimen. 6 hours of live training, plus another hour and a half for orientation. This is a commitment of 7.5 hours of in person training, and 4 hours of supplemental training for a total of 11.5 hours of training over the course of the Fall semester. Training days will be determined based on your schedule and that of the Tutor Training Coordinators.

Most of them have lost their short term memory and can no longer recognize their families, friends and surroundings; but their long term memory consisting of their childhood or years past can remain intact. Therefore, we create Memory Books, in which we categorize items such as food, holidays, sports, cars, flowers/gardens, people, people showing emotion such as hugs, etc. Volunteers create these books by finding and cutting out pictures or scenes from magazines, cards, calendars, etc. We sit with the patients and review these categories to see if any memory is stimulated and many times it is. We have had great results with this over the years as a tool for the mental stimulation for these patients. It takes a lot of time, hours and dedication to put these books together and a great deal of material is needed to complete them. This is truly a community project that touches and adds to the quality of life for our patients. Grace Healthcare Services is happy to provide all materials needed to make these books.

Or they might work on a crossword puzzle, color in a coloring book or do a word search. Volunteers are there to introduce the literacy experience while the pediatrician then reinforces the importance of reading by giving each child a brand new book we provide.

Musicians MOC Volunteer Musicians perform acoustically at the bedsides of patients and are always accompanied by a trained MOC Volunteer Guide. Volunteer Musicians play one song per room and interact with patients, their families and hospital staff. All lyrics MUST be appropriate for a hospital setting, therefore MOC provides an approved song list for musicians to select their repertoire for hospital visits. Any other material outside of the approved song list may be submitted to MOC staff for approval. Musician applicants must also submit a sample of their music prior to acceptance into the program. Volunteer Musicians must complete MOC's training process which is outlined below. Guides Volunteer Guides escort Volunteer Musicians from room to room as they play music for patients. Volunteer Guides knock on each hospital room door and ask patients if they feel like hearing music. They also introduce the musicians prior to their performances and guide them through the facility. Each guide is assigned to a specific healthcare facility. The Volunteer Guide is the \\\"eyes and ears\\\" of MOC during the Bedside Performance Program as well as the liaison between the hospital and the Volunteer Musician. But most importantly, Volunteer Guides know the protocols, policies and expectations of the hospitals or healthcare facilities in which they volunteer and are responsible for making sure these guidelines are upheld during the program. Volunteer Guides are critical to the success of the program.

Feel free to also check us out on our website to learn more about us at www.TEACH4Kids.org Who We Are: TEACH (Together Educating All Children in Hospitals) is an international not-for-profit organization that brings exciting, hands-on, STEM educational programming to children in hospitals. Our mission is to create an outlet for children of all ages to passionately engage with the sciences through the medium of fun, interactive experiments. Through engagement with practical science concepts, the children are challenged yet empowered. They emerge comforted and confident, encouraged to successfully cope with the trials that lie before them. TEACH modules challenge children to think creatively and bring an element of fun to an otherwise monotonous day. When TEACH volunteers visit, children get excited and get to experience STEM topics through more than 75 different interactive modules. Patients can learn about real life concepts while also having an exceptional amount of fun. They are amazed as they create silly putty while they learn about polymers and use basic engineering principles to build boats that really float. Observing the science of physiological respiration using yeast to inflate a balloon or discovering density by creating their very own lava lamps truly changes the way they view science, their stay in the hospital and life. What makes us special is that TEACH was founded by and is entirely run by students. In Spring 2013, TEACH&rsquo;s two co-founders were inspired to help with the need for interaction and activity, the craving for a personal bond, and the lack of mental and physical stimulation exhibited by hospitalized children. Under the mentorship and guidance of Dr. Edward Burns of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, TEACH was created to heal through teaching. TEACH began with monthly modules in a local Bronx hospital. In just over a year, TEACH grew to reach nine hospitals with hundreds of students signed up to volunteer from various universities around the tristate area. We have served over 3000 children, 30 hospitals internationally, and 1000 volunteers. What TEACH Needs TEACH is seeking an enthusiastic and passionate individual that wants to make a difference in the lives of medically ill children. We need someone who is committed to the organization both in the time they commit to as well as a financial responsibility to support the organization. Our Advisory board members are required to be active within the organization and play a significant role in the growth of the organization. Advisory Board Member Responsibilities TEACH Advisory board will meet periodically and communicates via email and phone at various times throughout the year. Advisory Board members are required to assist fundraising efforts and participate in at least one committee. Some of the things that they would need to participate in would be to promote events, participate in peer to peer campaigns, help with corporate partnerships and networking.

You can live anywhere in the state but are expected to participate in monthly calls and, ideally, quarterly in-person meetings. 100% of the money we raise goes directly to completing families' adoptions in your state. We are a team of smart, dedicated (and, we like to think, fun!) people who believe that a loving family is a basic human right. We are looking for Board Members who: - Are passionate about volunteering to help children. - Have creative fundraising ideas and the motivation and social network to make them happen! - Are connected to and/or interested in outreach to the local business community. - Enjoy connecting people and finding partnership opportunities. - Are comfortable reaching out to their network of family and friends about a good cause. - Have strong communication skills, and are highly organized. - Want a volunteer opportunity that makes a permanent difference!

Our nonprofit focuses on news about making the world a better place, particularly news related to topics such as global poverty, nonprofits, climate change and human rights. All volunteering is via the computer -- you can be anywhere in the world. The Daily Source is truly a 21st century journalism site. Our online software is incredibly easy to use and automates most of the layout process. Just drag and drop articles from one location to another and the page adjusts itself automatically. Editing the headlines is as easy as using Microsoft Word or sending an e-mail. You will receive guidance from our senior editors who are some of the top newspaper journalists in the U.S. Besides laying out the front page, you will find articles, videos, columns and other material from around the Internet for use on the site and make the final decision of what goes on the site. You will be doing real stuff that directly impacts our front page and our nonprofit's mission to help the world. You will also gain invaluable experience that will build your skills and look great on a resume. Some of our volunteers have gone on to work in the journalism field. Two of our volunteers started their own non-profit organization after eight months of volunteering with us. One of our editors was hired full-time by Wired.com and another was hired by Congress as the official congressional photographer of senators at public events. We have an extensive training process that is about a month long, so if we are going to train you, we need you to do a certain amount of hours in all to make it worth the time we put into it. Therefore, the Front Page Editor role is a minimum of 15 hours per week for a minimum of six months. If you can volunteer 20 hours or higher a week, then the minimum is only five months, or you can do 12 hours a week for seven and a half months. We tend to give preference to applicants who can do a sizable number of hours. All editors are credited at the bottom of the site each day, and daily editions are archived so your friends, family and future employers will see what you were part of creating. To view our front page, visit - http://dailysource.org/ To read more about us, view the links here - http://dailysource.org/about/site We usually also have the following openings (minimum hours per week and minimum number of months are in parenthesis). All these positions are telecommute so you don&rsquo;t have to drive or dress up, and can work from the comfort of your home. You might also be able to use our local Internet location, though there is some cost for that so virtual is preferred. If you apply for a position, you should view your commitment to it the same as if it were a paid position. We treat volunteers like normal staff and rely on them like staff. Our site is 99% volunteer run and we all depend on each other to make it a success. Please do not apply if you are viewing this opportunity as \\\"just a volunteer position\\\" and would treat it as less important than paid positions or other commitments you have. If you are in school, volunteering with us can function as an internship. Interns can usually receive credit with their school for their internships. Content Editor (10 hours a week for a minimum of 6 months): Searches the Internet for high quality articles, columns, editorials and videos, adds them to our system, and ranks them by quality. The front page editors pick from these to publish on the front page. Also does research and fact-checking when needed. This requires Internet surfing skills, strong understanding and judgment of the news, and attention to detail. Marketing and Social Media (6 hours a week for a minimum of 5 months): Help research potential media outlets and blogs to cover our site, e-mail our press releases to them, and keep track of coverage of our site that has occurred. We have a great website and need to get the word out about it.

Our nonprofit focuses on news about making the world a better place, particularly news related to topics such as global poverty, nonprofits, climate change and human rights. All volunteering is via the computer -- you can be anywhere in the world. The Daily Source is truly a 21st century journalism site. Our online software is incredibly easy to use and automates most of the layout process. Just drag and drop articles from one location to another and the page adjusts itself automatically. Editing the headlines is as easy as using Microsoft Word or sending an e-mail. You will receive guidance from our senior editors who are some of the top newspaper journalists in the U.S. Besides laying out the front page, you will find articles, videos, columns and other material from around the Internet for use on the site and make the final decision of what goes on the site. You will be doing real stuff that directly impacts our front page and our nonprofit's mission to help the world. You will also gain invaluable experience that will build your skills and look great on a resume. Some of our volunteers have gone on to work in the journalism field. Two of our volunteers started their own non-profit organization after eight months of volunteering with us. One of our editors was hired full-time by Wired.com and another was hired by Congress as the official congressional photographer of senators at public events. We have an extensive training process that is about a month long, so if we are going to train you, we need you to do a certain amount of hours in all to make it worth the time we put into it. Therefore, the Front Page Editor role is a minimum of 15 hours per week for a minimum of six months. If you can volunteer 20 hours or higher a week, then the minimum is only five months, or you can do 12 hours a week for seven and a half months. We tend to give preference to applicants who can do a sizable number of hours. All editors are credited at the bottom of the site each day, and daily editions are archived so your friends, family and future employers will see what you were part of creating. To view our front page, visit - http://dailysource.org/ To read more about us, view the links here - http://dailysource.org/about/site We usually also have the following openings (minimum hours per week and minimum number of months are in parenthesis). All these positions are telecommute so you don&rsquo;t have to drive or dress up, and can work from the comfort of your home. You might also be able to use our local Internet location, though there is some cost for that so virtual is preferred. If you apply for a position, you should view your commitment to it the same as if it were a paid position. We treat volunteers like normal staff and rely on them like staff. Our site is 99% volunteer run and we all depend on each other to make it a success. Please do not apply if you are viewing this opportunity as \\\"just a volunteer position\\\" and would treat it as less important than paid positions or other commitments you have. If you are in school, volunteering with us can function as an internship. Interns can usually receive credit with their school for their internships. Content Editor (10 hours a week for a minimum of 6 months): Searches the Internet for high quality articles, columns, editorials and videos, adds them to our system, and ranks them by quality. The front page editors pick from these to publish on the front page. Also does research and fact-checking when needed. This requires Internet surfing skills, strong understanding and judgment of the news, and attention to detail. Marketing and Social Media (6 hours a week for a minimum of 5 months): Help research potential media outlets and blogs to cover our site, e-mail our press releases to them, and keep track of coverage of our site that has occurred.

For many children who face grief early in their lives, it can be a very isolating experience due to a lack of understanding and a lack of supportive people who understand their emotions and needs. Good Grief, a nonprofit in Morristown and Princeton, New Jersey, specializes in supporting the needs of grieving children through free peer support programs, education, and advocacy. Good Grief was created in 2004 and serves over 550 participants every month. However, not everyone who would like to benefit from our services has the opportunity to do so due to transportation and other needs. In order to meet the needs of urban youth, Good Grief created In Community, a program that supports underserved children and families. In Community launched in Jersey City in 2018, and caters to children ages 6-18 who have experienced the loss of someone important in their lives, as well as providing support to their parent or guardian so that they can learn how to better understand their children&rsquo;s needs. In April 2019, we will expand our reach to the families of Newark and hope you will join us along the way! In Community will reduce isolation by creating a community of children of similar ages who have experienced loss, as well as give them the tools to develop healthy coping skills to adapt to their current and other adversities they may experience. Come and be a part of the mission today, where a team of dedicated volunteers and staff ensure that no child ever has to grieve alone.

Complementary Volunteers are certified/trained professionals who can provide complementary modalities of reflexology, music, imagery and touch therapies such as Reiki, massage, therapeutic touch and healing hands.

Administrative Volunteers provide help to the staff in our Edison office by assisting with typing, addressing cards, organizing newsletters, creating packets, collating manuals and other varied clerical duties Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, huggable dolls/bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Junior Volunteers consist of groups such as girl/boy scouts or young people who wish to honor our patients by making holiday cards, posters, wall hangings and memory books. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families and friends of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network.

Sprout is a non-profit organization based in New York City focused on providing innovative programs for adults with developmental disabilities.With our network of resources and dedicated volunteers, which we call leaders, Sprout opens up fascinating new worlds to people with disabilities. Sprout's Overnight Vacations Program is looking for individuals who have the energy, motivation and desire to work with adults with developmental disabilities. What do Sprout leaders do? Sprout leaders' primary goal is to give adults with developmental disabilities the opportunity to experience and enjoy recreational, educational and leisure activities through overnight vacations. Leaders are responsible for the overall safety and enjoyment of their group, 24 hours a day, while on a Sprout trip. Duties include safety monitoring, personal hygiene assistance, providing physical and emotional support, activity planning, budgeting, logistics, and enhancing fun. The work is hard yet immensely rewarding as you develop leadership skills and gain insight into your own abilities. What type of training is provided? Leaders must complete a pre-service training, which provides the necessary procedures and tools to run a successful and enjoyable vacation. Leaders who are drivers receive extra training on how to safely drive our 15-passenger vans. In addition, all leaders receive a copy of Sprout's Leadership Handbook to help with policies and guidelines. What is the time commitment? Sprout vacations last 3 - 7 days depending on the time of year and destination of the trip. When a leader is selected for an overnight vacation, Sprout asks that the leader dedicate themselves to stay with their group throughout the entire duration of the vacation. Some leaders only choose to lead one trip a year while others spend several months with us leading up to 8 trips or more. Sprout strives to make our program flexible for our leaders based on the amount of time leaders can give. Do leaders have any free or personal time while on a trip? Sprout trips are working vacations for the leaders who choose to participate. Because Sprout leaders are responsible for their group 24 hours a day, there is no free or personal time allotted. In order to give our participants the opportunity to experience and enjoy a vacation, Sprout leaders must be available at all times to provide the support any one participant may need. What type of trips can Sprout leaders expect to join? A majority of Sprout trips take place within a day's drive of New York City. Destinations include Atlantic City, Amish Country, Boston, Lake George, Cleveland, Maine and Virginia Beach. Exotic trips like cruises, Hawaii, and Europe are presented to leaders who have demonstrated high levels of commitment, service hours and have gained positive feedback from participants and Sprout office staff. Are there any special skills or requirements? No special background or education is required to become a Sprout leader. We encourage people from all cultures and professions, and of all ethnic and educational backgrounds. Once accepted into the program, you will receive the necessary tools to sign up for outings and how to assist our participants. Requirements include: -21+ years old -Provide references -Participate in training session -Willingness to complete necessary background checks -Evaluate participants' behavior -Fluent English -Willing to drive a 15 passenger van -Love to travel & have fun!

Aging out of foster care without a life plan, without a permanent place to live, without a job places these young people at great risk. These risks include homelessness, unemployment, substance abuse, criminal involvement and Mental health issues. CASA of Union County is actively recruiting volunteers as part of our Fostering Futures project to become advocate/mentors for older foster youth. These volunteers will work with the young people and help them transition out of the system and ensure that they have the life skills and plans they need to have a safe, stable and successful future. As trained advocate/mentors, CASA volunteers are appointed by judges to be a voice for these children in court. As their advocate, you will be the voice for the young person in court, making sure that the judge knows what is in the young person's best interests. As their mentor you will work with the young person to help them make the best decisions and plans for their futures.

Nearly 70 percent of those placed in solitary had a mental health disorder, with nearly 37% having two or more diagnoses. \uf0b7 Youth suffer abuse while in adult prison: once incarcerated in an adult prison, one in four youth surveyed reported physical abuse; 5% reported sexual abuse.

Four-month-old Bosley is a puppy with a special mission. One day, he will provide enhanced independence and mobility to a person with disabilities - whether they're blind or visually impaired, or have a disability other than blindness. But Bosley isn't growing up at the Guide Dog Foundation for the Blind. Each year, the Guide Dog Foundation breeds about 300 exceptional puppies, and it's vital that Bosley and other pups like him spend the first year of their lives with surrounded by the love and security of volunteer foster families called puppy walkers. Puppy walkers help Foundation puppies grow up to be confident dogs. What's involved in raising a Guide Dog Foundation puppy? Bosley went to live with his puppy walkers when he was about nine weeks old. He's learning basic obedience and social skills while being exposed to many different situations. People who raise Guide Dog Foundation puppies say it is the most rewarding thing they've ever done. Puppy raisers come from everywhere - stay-at-home moms or dads, teachers, college students, retirees, people with flexible work environments - and are crucial members of the Guide Dog Foundation family. By opening their hearts and homes to a puppy, a puppy raiser plays a crucial role in helping a person with disabilities live an independent life. Every puppy walker family works with a Guide Dog Foundation puppy adviser, who is available to answer questions and offer guidance and support. When he is about 14 months old, Bosley will return to the Guide Dog Foundation's Smithtown campus to begin his training as a guide or service dog. Puppy raisers will admit it's tough to say good-bye, but when they see the pup they raised take its place at the side of someone with disabilities, the ache they feel turns pride. There are puppies waiting now to join your loving home for a chance to start their careers.

Volunteers at Brooklyn Historical Society (BHS) offer valuable assistance to staff, visitors, and the public in a variety of ways. Passionate about the past, present, and future of Brooklyn, volunteers are individuals who enjoy engaging with the diverse communities who make up our great borough. BHS welcomes volunteers who have a sincere desire to lend their time and their skills to the institution. Volunteer opportunities are subject to availability and applicant&rsquo;s qualifications. Brooklyn Historical Society (BHS) is pleased to announce An Opening, an audio and visual installation by Brooklyn-based artist Kameelah Janan Rasheed, who is known for her immersive large-scale installations, text-based art work, publications, and audio recordings. Rasheed draws on BHS&rsquo;s Muslims in Brooklyn oral histories to create a unique audio and visual experience that challenges narrow conceptions of Muslim identity and history. The installation and oral histories are part of Muslims in Brooklyn, a public arts and history project launched by BHS in 2017 to preserve and amplify stories of Brooklyn&rsquo;s diverse Muslim communities. An Opening invites visitors to experience these conversations both visually and aurally as they explore an ecosystem of sound and art that moves beyond linear narrative, fixed categories, and static identities. Visitors to the exhibition are outfitted with an iPod Touch and headphones. As they move around the room, they hear sounds of speech and snippets of stories, as if encountering conversations in a crowded room. As they stand facing each new work of art in the gallery, the iPod Touch plays an audio piece, selected by the artist, to accompany the image. Rasheed has created a non-linear and fluid experience determined entirely by the body&rsquo;s movement and positioning, offering each visitor a chance to direct their own individual experience. BHS is seeking volunteers to help support the visitor experience of An Opening. Responsibilities Distribute iPods and headsets to guests Help answer tech related questions Make sure guests do not leave the exhibition area with the tech equipment Keep an eye out for guests who may be mishandling or abusing the equipment Provide translations (transcripts of exhibit text will be available in several languages) to guests on an as-needed basis Be familiar with the building and its features (location of restrooms, galleries, library, exits, etc.) Required Skills Superior customer service skills Demonstrated ability to problem-solve quickly and efficiently Proactive, action oriented team member willing to take direction from supervisors Excellent communications skills Experience and comfort with technology (iPod touch, headphones) Team player with an engaging, outgoing personality.

LTA Volunteers should be enthusiastic about arts education/integration and able to make a commitment to assist a teaching artist one day each week for the duration of the 20-week residency. LTA places teaching artists in New York City public school classrooms, where they collaborate with teachers to create process-oriented art projects that examine ideas and themes related to the school curriculum. In these 20-week residencies, teaching artists introduce art techniques and concepts and encourage students to view, analyze, and discuss works of art. Founded in 1937, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation is dedicated to promoting the understanding and appreciation of art, architecture, and other manifestations of visual culture, primarily of the modern and contemporary periods. The Guggenheim realizes this mission through exceptional exhibitions, education programs, research initiatives, and publications. The Guggenheim strives to engage and educate an increasingly diverse international audience through its unique network of museums and partnerships. With nearly three million annual visitors worldwide, the Guggenheim and its network is one of the most visited cultural institutions in the world. Responsibilities of a LTA Volunteer include: Distribute all art materials to students as directed by teaching artist. Help to maintain an organized classroom throughout each session and manage clean-up and storage of materials. Photograph (when advised by teaching artist) students at work in the classroom. Assist the teaching artist in hanging in-school exhibitions and other displays of student artwork throughout the year As advised by teaching artist, work with students one-on-one and in small groups as needed. This is a volunteer position. Volunteers receive invitations to Guggenheim programs, free admission to museums across the country, discounts at the Guggenheim restaurants and store, a travel stipend to cover the cost of travel to and from the school, and the opportunity to learn about art education, museum education and modern and contemporary art. If you have any questions, please feel free to email learningthroughart@guggenheim.org. Volunteer commitment is once weekly from approximately mid-October through early May.

Grace Healthcare Services is a Hospice organization that cares for patients throughout NJ. Veterans at the end of life. Volunteers are an essential component of this care. WHY A NEED FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS? -Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect to patients who have served our country. -Veterans share a common bond and code of conduct. -The camaraderie that exists between Veterans has proven to be a great support for the Veterans we care for. As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee. Please help us honor our Veterans by giving them the gift of your time. If you are interested or have questions please contact the Grace Healthcare Services Volunteer Department at 732-225-4100 ext. 138 to inquire about the Veteran-to-Veteran Volunteer Program.

Grace Healthcare Services is a Hospice organization that cares for patients throughout NJ. Veterans at the end of life. Volunteers are an essential component of this care. WHY A NEED FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS? -Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect to patients who have served our country. -Veterans share a common bond and code of conduct. -The camaraderie that exists between Veterans has proven to be a great support for the Veterans we care for. As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee. Please help us honor our Veterans by giving them the gift of your time.

Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, memory bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network. They often make phone calls to check up on family members and also send cards of comfort and care.

Consequently, we're always looking for volunteer softball coaches, particularly those with experience playing or coaching sports at the college level and beyond. Currently, we have an emphasis and focus on finding more female softball coaches who can serve as role models for the girls in our program. We firmly believe that this plays a critical role in impacting the perceptions and future aspirations of our girls and how they see and understand leadership in the world. Over the long term, we aspire to achieve at least a 50-50 gender split of coaches.

You would work with a group of students for 2 hours per week between 9am to noon. (You can do this on one day.) This is a great opportunity for students who are majoring (or have already earned a degree) in the course area to enhance their knowledge and experience, and who would like to leverage their knowledge in the subject area to support others with their learning growth and development. As a tutor, you will collaborate with a local coordinator to improve students&rsquo; performance while being supported and guided by experienced academic support professionals. To apply, you must: 1. Have received an A- or A in the introduction to the subject course you are applying to tutor. 2. Have a GPA at or above 3.2, or have received a degree recently. 3. Be willing to complete 11.5 hours of College Reading and Learning Aligned (CRLA) training at City College of New York. All tutors are also expected to complete a four session comprehensive, professional training regimen. 6 hours of live training, plus another hour and a half for orientation. This is a commitment of 7.5 hours of in person training, and 4 hours of supplemental training for a total of 11.5 hours of training over the course of the Fall semester. We can accommodate your schedule for the live trainings. CT's tutoring program has been successful in helping students gain access to support that they otherwise would not have received, given their limited time spent on campus. Having tutors in these sessions early in the semester will allow us to employ strategies to reduce withdrawals and student failure rates.

ABOUT PKD Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is one of the most common, life-threatening genetic diseases affecting thousands in America and millions worldwide. There is no treatment or cure. You can help bring a treatment within reach. Polycystic Kidney Disease causes fluid filled cysts to form on both kidneys. Over time, these cysts grow and multiply, sometimes dramatically in size. For most patients, their PKD ultimately causes the kidneys to shut down. Once that happens, dialysis and transplant are their only options to prolong life. Parents with the dominant form of PKD have a 50% chance of passing the disease on to each of their children. For the recessive form, ARPKD, parents have usually never heard of PKD until their newborn is diagnosed with it. For 30% of newborns, ARPKD is fatal.

Grace Healthcare Services is a Hospice organization that cares for patients throughout NJ. Veterans at the end of life. Volunteers are an essential component of this care. WHY A NEED FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS? -Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect to patients who have served our country. -Veterans share a common bond and code of conduct. -The camaraderie that exists between Veterans has proven to be a great support for the Veterans we care for. As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee. Please help us honor our Veterans by giving them the gift of your time.

Here is an opportunity to help underprivileged children, to help under-served children, to help ALL children, and even to help adults who can't read. Have you ever wanted to be a part of an amazing convergence of forces that is about to change the way the whole world does something? Have you ever heard anyone talk about a problem and say, \\\"that problem is impossible to fix,\\\" or, \\\"that's the way it's always been; there's no changing it.\\\" Well, people say that about world hunger, world peace, and low literacy. Two years ago, the Barbara Bush Foundation and Dollar General sponsored the $7million XPrize for Adult Literacy to bring in teams from around the world to develop an app-based solution to the adult literacy crisis in America. The parameters of the contest were that teams had to build an app that would teach reading to illiterate and low literate adults without any assistance from another adult (an \\\"independent learning\\\" app). At the American Youth Literacy Foundation (dba Youth Lit and YouthLit.org), our focus has always been on children's literacy. We joined this competition but opted out after a year. However, during that year we learned a lot, and since engaging in that experience, we have seen the future potential for this new, digital approach to the reading crisis. In the past several months we have made major progress on our own \\\"independent learning,\\\" smartphone app for children's literacy. Today we are further along than ever in the creation of this amazing new learning tool that teaches children how to read with little to no intervention required by a grown-up or older sibling or a tutor. The app is a digital representation of our patented reading curriculum that we have been using nationwide, for the past 10 years, the same curriculum we've been training tutors in, who, in turn, have taught thousands of children how to read. But now we need volunteers like you to help us put the prototype of the app in the hands of kids who are learning how to read so they can play with it and provide critical feedback that will help us finish the app and make it available to kids everywhere for FREE downloading from the Apple store and Google play. We believe that this app could literally solve the literacy crisis in America. If you have an interest in being a reading mentor to a child and want to help with this project, if you like working with kids, if you want to help them learn how to read, if literacy is something that you feel passionate about, and if finding a lasting solution to the literacy crisis is something you want to get involved in, then please reply today. We need your help. Thank you! We truly look forward to hearing from you : ) Please include a short note telling us about your interest in literacy. We will provide you with a letter explaining our tutoring program and more about this opportunity.

They are in essence, the voice of the child, in court. CASA Volunteers interview parents, doctors, educators, foster parents, therapists, and anyone else involved in the life of the child they are assigned. Their goal is to provide child-focused reports to the court, which will lead to a speedy, safe, and permanent placement for the child. This is why it is imperative for these volunteers to go through extensive training. All Volunteers are screened closely for objectivity, competence, and commitment. You can become a CASA volunteer if: You have never been convicted of a crime and can pass a criminal background check. You are not personally involved with DCP&P (the state child welfare agency). Your job (and your life) is flexible. You are at least 21 years old. You are willing to make a one-year commitment. You pass CASA&rsquo;s screening process. Typically, a CASA volunteer will spend an average 10-20 hours per month working with their assigned case. Each case is different, so the amount of time required to get the job done varies significantly. We do require the volunteer to visit the child once every two weeks and be in court once every three months. CASA for Children of Bergen County asks that you make a one-year commitment. We prefer that a volunteer continue with their assigned case until it is permanently resolved which typically involves an 18 months - two year commitment. One of the primary benefits of the CASA program is that, unlike many caseworkers, most CASA volunteers remain a consistent figure during the course of case proceedings. This provides important continuity for children. Potential CASA volunteers must attend an Information Session, be interviewed and be accepted into training. CASA provides extensive training for our volunteers so that they are prepared to provide children with the support they desperately need. CASA volunteers undergo a thorough 36-hour training course. They learn about courtroom procedure, effective advocacy techniques for children, and specific topics ranging from child abuse to early childhood development and adolescent behavior. In addition, trainees must attend 3 hours of court observation before being sworn-in by the presiding Family Court judge. Volunteers are required to attend 12 hours of continued training for each year of service. Our training course is offered several times a year and will prepare you for your volunteer experience.

All of us have gifts to share. Whether it be offering companionship by conversation, holding someone's hand, playing music, reading to them or just making them feel special. We ask you to share an hour or two a week, more if you're able to provide comfort and caring to those who will provide you with much more than you will ever imagine. Volunteer Opportunities: Companionship Volunteers work directly with patients providing companionship, offering friendly visits, reading to patients, writing letters, offering a gentle touch or sharing a quiet moment. Ascend Hospice is seeking certified Reiki, massage therapy and/or reflexology practitioners to serve our end of life population in finding comfort, relaxation and peace during their final time with us. These practices have proven to be beneficial during end-of-life care assisting with anxiety, emotional release and general comfort which is instrumental to patients and their families. Certification is required and hospice training is provided. Pet Therapy Volunteers provide companionship from our certified therapy dogs. Pet therapy provides numerous benefits like encouraging movement and physical stimulation and it provides mental benefits like socialization, mental stimulation, companionship, and unconditional love. Please consider sharing your loving pet with us and bring some much needed smiles. Pets must be certified as therapy animals by an organization like TDI Therapy Dogs International- see website here http://www.tdi-dog.org/ or in South Jersey - Bright and Beautiful Therapy Dogs - see website here http://www.golden-dogs.org/ Music Volunteers are volunteers who specialize in sharing songs or instrumental music with patients and their loved ones. Whether the Music Volunteer is sharing an existing musical skill or playing music via the radio or digital device, the goal is to enhance the quality of life of our patients. Often, regularly scheduled visits are requested, however Music Volunteers may also be asked to provide musical visits on an occasional basis for one patient/family or for a group of patients at a facility as outreach for the local hospice agency. Hospice is built on the philosophy that we care for our patients in mind, body and soul. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network. They often make phone calls to check up on family members and also send cards of comfort and care.

Complementary Volunteers are certified/trained professionals who can provide complementary modalities of reflexology, music, imagery and touch therapies such as Reiki, massage, therapeutic touch and healing hands. Pet Therapy Volunteers provide certified/trained pets who visit with patients. These animals provide loving memories for some and give unconditional love helping our patients feel connected to a larger world. Administrative Volunteers provide help to the staff in our Edison office by assisting with typing, addressing cards, organizing newsletters, creating packets, collating manuals and other varied clerical duties Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, huggable dolls/bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Junior Volunteers consist of groups such as girl/boy scouts or young people who wish to honor our patients by making holiday cards, posters, wall hangings and memory books. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families and friends of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network. Hospice training classes are required for Companionship and Complementary Volunteers. They are free of charge and offered on an ongoing basis.

Health Equity Initiative (HEI) is a 501(c)3 member-driven nonprofit membership organization dedicated to building and sustaining a global community that engages across sectors and disciplines to advance health equity. The organization provides its members and broader community with the knowledge, skills and innovative approaches to tackle health inequities, helps them build capacity within their own organizations and communities, and facilitates opportunities for multi-sectoral and multidisciplinary collaboration in support of health equity. HEI also offers professional development and networking opportunities through lectures, webinars, and training programs. Since its inception, Health Equity Initiative has been devoted to the development of innovative solutions to address the social determinants of health - the conditions in places where people live, work, and play, which can affect their health, functioning and quality of life. Health Equity Initiative is at an inflection point in its growth trajectory. As an organization that functions primarily through a volunteer core - an acting Executive Director who provides her time in-kind, an active board, and a group of committed volunteers-augmented by a limited part-time and project-specific freelance staff, HEI has managed to accomplish a significant amount and maintained momentum in developing cross-sectoral programming, capacity training and education and information exchanges for a burgeoning health equity movement. But we recognize that the timing is right to seek funding to strengthen our organization&rsquo;s structure and build its capacity. This would allow us to extend our capabilities and be responsive to the increased urgency that currently exists in recognizing and addressing social determinants of health (SDOH). [SDOH are defined as the social, economic, and physical conditions in the environments where people live, work, and play that can affect their health, functioning and quality-of-life outcomes.] There is a growing understanding amongst funders as well as within community-based organizations, health systems, public health entities, and municipal and private planning agencies, that creating a culture of health and developing positive health outcomes that are measurable requires an understanding of the social determinants of health in each community as well as to support greater health equity by combatting the negative effective of certain social determinants [i.e. poverty, limited transportation, lack of access to healthy food, unclean air or water, unsafe housing, unemployment, lack of cultural competence in clinical settings, low health and media literacy, etc.] and removing barriers to improved health and social outcomes. Health Equity Initiative, as a thought leader in the field that represents multiple entities dedicated to health equity, is well positioned to taking a leading role in the much-needed campaign to recognize the role of SDOH and to bring together multi-sectoral stakeholders to create health equity. We have 4 openings on our board of directors. We are looking for passionate, energetic and motivated Board members who have experience with fundraising for social causes, have a network that spans sectors, and experience connecting subject matters experts with philanthropists. Although a minimal financial contribution of $5,000 is expected, equally important is a willingness to take an active role in developing the organization through the donation of time, fundraising skills, and energy. N.B. While in-person board meetings occur in New York City, many meetings take place virtually (conference call or GotoMeeting).

Most of those presents are not very rewarding. Tons of sweaters, fuzzy slippers, and ties end up in the dark corners of our closets. It is no surprise that a growing number of people, who seek meaning more than \\\"stuff,\\\" are starting to show their love by donating in a friend&rsquo;s name in lieu of giving traditional presents. The challenge for nonprofits is that it is simply too daunting to provide the requisite gift-like experience (tangible charitable gifts, wish lists and registries, and personalized printed greeting cards) that can make a donation feel like a rewarding gift. ChangingThePresent.org provides those tools to facilitate this type of giving for nonprofits and donors. We are about to take ChangingThePresent to the next level. That involves expanding from the initial 400 organizations to inviting all 1.1 million nonprofits, as well as adding additional causes and categories. Within each cause area, we will seek growth funding, invite advisors, recruit nonprofits, use media and social media to raise awareness among the public, and recruit celebrities to lend their voices. Imagine the impact we can make together as more and more people adopt this type of meaningful gift-giving! Casual and Friendly Office Environment This is a great place to work. We have had interns and volunteers from all over the United States and more than fifty countries. The atmosphere is energetic, creative, and fun. We value brainstorming, initiative, sharing, and collaborating. Think of it is a laboratory, studio, seminar, or incubator. We are also casual.

Use your skills, experience, knowledge, creativity and talent. Assume responsibility. Be a leader. Learn a tremendous amount. Work with great people from around the world and have the best time. Enhance your resume and get a glowing letter recommendation. Work in our Manhattan office or remotely. You will engage nonprofits, foundations, associations, thought leaders, media, social media, partners, and celebrities. You will help grow the movement to facilitate and encourage this type of meaningful giving. Use your professional skills in any of these fields: strategy, partnerships, finance, communications, social media, graphics, research, community management, Public Relations (PR), Human Resources (HR), marketing, event management, organizing, and activism. Focus on your favorite cause, Support Women and Women's Rights or other causes, including: Disaster Relief, Education, Housing, Human Rights, Hunger, Millennium Goals, Water, Community, Aging, Arts & Culture, Children & Youth, Civil Society, Peace, Public Broadcast, Refugees, Veterans, Women, Environment, Agriculture, Animal Welfare, Environment, Global Warming, Health and Safety, Blindness & Vision, Bullying, Slavery and Human Trafficking, Cancer, Disabilities, Global Health, HIV/AIDS, Landmines, LGBTQ, Medical Research, Literacy, Mental Health, Population, Opportunity, Micro-credit, Poverty Alleviation, Social Entrepreneurs, Technology and the Digital Divide, Music Education, Art Education, STEM Education, Books for kids, Catholic, Christian, Jewish, Religious, Churches, Hispanic, African-American, Asian, Indian, Chinese, etc. Channeling New Funds to Nonprofits While a million nonprofits desperately need more funding, Americans spend $250 billion a year on birthday, holiday, and other presents. A pioneering nonprofit, Heifer International, has shown that nonprofits can capture some of that money by making donations, given in a friend&rsquo;s name, feel like a present. It works! They raise $115 million a year this way. Imagine how much more gift money could be captured by nonprofits addressing popular causes, including your favorites. The challenge is that it is too daunting for most nonprofits to provide a gift-like experience: tangible donation opportunities, wish lists, gift registries, and personalized printed greeting cards. About www.ChangingThePresent.org Our nonprofit site provides a gift-like experience, which helps 400 leading nonprofits capture money normally spent on traditional presents. The NY Times called it an \\\"amazon.com of the nonprofit world.\\\" We are now about to invite all million nonprofits to join the site. We are also providing each with their own private, charitable gift sites so they can send supporters without exposing them to other nonprofits. See a sample: http://SampleNGO.GiftsForHumanity.org. We facilitate this type of giving for individuals and nonprofits, and we promote this as a social norm. The Environment This is a great place to work. We have interns and volunteers from all over the United States and all around the world. The atmosphere is energetic, creative, and fun. We value brainstorming, initiative, sharing, and collaborating. Think of it is a laboratory, studio, seminar, or incubator. We are also casual. We are interested in your brains, creativity and heart, rather than your attire. Want to work in jeans, t-shirt and flip-flops? That&rsquo;s fine with us. Who, Where, When We are glad to hear from great high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as professionals who want to make the greatest impact with their skills. Work at our office or remotely. We are conveniently located at 7th Avenue and 33 Street, across from Penn Station in Manhattan. Full-time or part-time, school-year or summer, day or evening, weekday or weekend. We are glad to have your help whenever and wherever you are available. Unpaid We provide a great experience, but this is an unpaid position. Learn More, Apply Now, and Share Are you ready for a great experience and eager to make a difference? Please see the slideshow at www.ChangingThePresent-Join.org.

The ability to read transforms lives and empowers children to reach their full potential. Research shows that when students can read at grade level by fourth grade, they have a greater opportunity to succeed in school and beyond. With your help, we can equip students with the foundational skills they need to read at grade level. Each week, you will meet with your student for a one-on-one tutoring session to help them develop strong literacy skills and discover a passion for reading. We'll provide a structured curriculum, in-person training, and ongoing support to help your student thrive. Rigorous research has proven that Reading Partners significantly increases reading proficiency. No teaching experience required and anyone over the age of 14 can volunteer.

Grace Healthcare Services is a Hospice organization that cares for patients throughout NJ. Veterans at the end of life. Volunteers are an essential component of this care. WHY A NEED FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS? -Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect to patients who have served our country. -Veterans share a common bond and code of conduct. -The camaraderie that exists between Veterans has proven to be a great support for the Veterans we care for. As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee. Please help us honor our Veterans by giving them the gift of your time.

Feel free to also check us out on our website to learn more about us at www.TEACH4Kids.org Who We Are: TEACH (Together Educating All Children in Hospitals) is an international not-for-profit organization that brings exciting, hands-on, STEM educational programming to children in hospitals. Our mission is to create an outlet for children of all ages to passionately engage with the sciences through the medium of fun, interactive experiments. Through engagement with practical science concepts, the children are challenged yet empowered. They emerge comforted and confident, encouraged to successfully cope with the trials that lie before them. TEACH modules challenge children to think creatively and bring an element of fun to an otherwise monotonous day. When TEACH volunteers visit, children get excited and get to experience STEM topics through more than 75 different interactive modules. Patients can learn about real life concepts while also having an exceptional amount of fun. They are amazed as they create silly putty while they learn about polymers and use basic engineering principles to build boats that really float. Observing the science of physiological respiration using yeast to inflate a balloon or discovering density by creating their very own lava lamps truly changes the way they view science, their stay in the hospital and life. What makes us special is that TEACH was founded by and is entirely run by students. In Spring 2013, TEACH&rsquo;s two co-founders were inspired to help with the need for interaction and activity, the craving for a personal bond, and the lack of mental and physical stimulation exhibited by hospitalized children. Under the mentorship and guidance of Dr. Edward Burns of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, TEACH was created to heal through teaching. TEACH began with monthly modules in a local Bronx hospital. In just over a year, TEACH grew to reach nine hospitals with hundreds of students signed up to volunteer from various universities around the tristate area. We have served over 3000 children, 30 hospitals internationally, and 1000 volunteers. What TEACH Needs TEACH is seeking an enthusiastic and passionate individual that wants to make a difference in the lives of medically ill children. We need someone who is committed to the organization both in the time they commit to as well as a financial responsibility to support the organization. Our Advisory board members are required to be active within the organization and play a significant role in the growth of the organization. Advisory Board Member Responsibilities TEACH Advisory board will meet periodically and communicates via email and phone at various times throughout the year. Advisory Board members are required to assist fundraising efforts and participate in at least one committee.
