Guiding Principles As a board member, I understand that I owe duties of care, loyalty, and obedience to the organization and the children it serves. The duty of care is the duty to monitor Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s activities, see that its mission is being accomplished, and guard its financial resources. The duty of loyalty is the duty to avoid conflicts of interest. The duty of obedience is to be faithful to Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s mission and to comply with the law. I will uphold these duties and do my utmost to ensure that Maya&rsquo;s Hope performs its mission and achieves its goals. Principal Commitments Act with integrity and represent the interests of all people served by the organization. Recognize that decisions of the board can be made only by a majority vote at a) a board meeting or b) in writing. Respect the majority decisions of the board. Participate in: Board self-evaluation programs. Board development workshops, seminars, and other educational events that enhance skills as a board member. Handle information with discretion and confidentiality as necessary. Exercise authority as a board member only when acting in a meeting with the full board or as delegated by the board with members. Collaborate with members who serve this board and leave personal prejudices out of all board discussions. Represent Maya&rsquo;s Hope in a positive and supportive manner at all times. Display courteous conduct at all board and committee meetings. Refrain from intruding on administrative issues that are the responsibility of management, except to monitor the results of the organization. Monitor the financial condition of the organization. Understand and comply with the bylaws of Maya&rsquo;s Hope. Avoid conflicts of interest between my position as a board member and my personal or professional life (as referenced in Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s Conflict of Interest Policy.) If such a conflict does arise, I will disclose that conflict to the board and refrain from voting on matters in which I have conflict. Liability of Board Members As a fully incorporated non-profit, Maya&rsquo;s Hope enjoys the same limited liability that any corporation does. Corporations offer the protection of limited liability to corporate directors and officers. Limited liability means that the organization's directors and officers have limited personal liability for business debts. Generally, creditors can only go after corporate assets and insurance to satisfy liabilities incurred by the corporation. This principle applies, however, only when the board has fulfilled its basic duties, such as the duty of care. A board member is legally bound to exercise reasonable care when he or she makes a decision for the organization. Reasonable care is what an 'ordinarily prudent' person in a similar situation would do. Examples of when a board member may have personal liability include (but are not limited to) when a board member: personally and directly injures someone. personally guarantees a bank loan or a business debt on which the corporation defaults, or behaves in a fraudulent or illegal manner that causes harm, Maya&rsquo;s Hope maintains a Directors & Officers liability insurance policy. Responsibilities of Secretary: Meeting Minutes The primary task of the secretary of an executive board is to record and maintain the minutes of each board meeting. Meeting minutes are detail reports that highlight the predetermined agenda of each conference as well as what actually took place. For example, a secretary may notate the following: \\\"The meeting began at 11 a.m. The first order of business was for the president to discuss potential changes to the organization&rsquo;s mission statement; however, he was unable to attend the gathering due to medical reasons. The issue was put on hold until a later date.\\\" Record Maintenance As the custodian of corporate records, the secretary of an executive board must maintain all company files in a manner compliant with organizational policies as well as any laws that regulate the industry. These documents may include the firm&rsquo;s article of incorporation, bylaws and employee contact lists, as well as financial records. He must also develop and enforce policies regarding access to these confidential files. Security controls, such as who can access which files and what approvals are needed to do so, are examples of the many procedures he must implement. Depending on the industry in which the company does business, the secretary of the executive board may be required to file certain documents with the government. For example, a nonprofit organization must meet certain criteria to maintain its tax-exempt status. It is often the responsibility of the secretary to ensure that all necessary paperwork is completed and returned to the Internal Revenue Service. Organizational Representative It is not uncommon for the secretary of an executive board to serve as its signing officer. This designation gives her the authority to sign documents, such as contracts, checks and credit applications, on behalf of the organization. Because this responsibility wields so much power, many firms implement a system of checks and balances so it is not abused. For instance, before signing a service agreement, the secretary may need the express written permission of two other board members. She must follow these guidelines or risk termination and, in severe cases, criminal prosecution.", "title": "Board Member Opening at Maya's Hope", "zipcode": "10001", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D2862432%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "Maya's Hope"}, {"end": null, "description": "Do you have a strong passion for the development of Africa?

Most of those presents are not very rewarding. Tons of sweaters, fuzzy slippers, and ties end up in the dark corners of our closets. It is no surprise that a growing number of people, who seek meaning more than things, are starting to show their love by donating in a friend&rsquo;s name in lieu of giving traditional presents. The challenge for nonprofits is that it is simply too daunting to provide the requisite gift-like experience (tangible charitable gifts, wish lists and registries, and personalized printed greeting cards) that can make a donation feel like a rewarding gift. ChangingThePresent.org provides those tools to facilitate this type of giving for nonprofits and donors. We are about to take ChangingThePresent to the next level. That involves expanding from the initial 400 organizations to invite all 1.1 million nonprofits; adding additional causes and categories. Within each cause area, we will seek growth funding, invite advisors, recruit nonprofits, use media and social media to raise awareness among the public, and recruit celebrities to lend their voices. Imagine the impact we can make together as more and more people adopt this type of meaningful giving. Casual and Friendly Office Environment This is a great place to work. We have had interns and volunteers from all over the United States and more than forty countries. The atmosphere is energetic, creative, and fun.

The Petition Colleges and universities could save students billions of dollars a year on textbooks by adopting these policies. We call on them to: Consider the cost when selecting textbooks. Use free Open Source textbooks whenever possible. Do not require university-specific editions or (unless essential) the latest edition, which undermine the used book market. Refrain from requiring students to purchase expensive access codes for homework assignments and quizzes.

Make a Difference! Use your Communications and PR skills, experience, knowledge, creativity and talent. Help lower the cost of college textbooks and save billions of dollars for millions of college students. Take a leadership role on our dynamic and creative international team. Work from our Manhattan office or remotely. Enhance your resume and get a glowing letter of recommendation. The Problem We Address The skyrocketing cost of college textbooks undermines the education and lives of millions of students, who spend an average of $1,300 a year on books and supplies. 70% of them cannot afford books for all their classes. 30% of them are unable to take classes they want, simply because the books are too expensive. Tacked onto student loans, the textbook costs can haunt them for years. We Are Going to Change the Situation Colleges and universities could greatly decrease the cost of textbooks by adopting ten measures, described in the petition below. We are leading a movement to encourage students, faculty, recent graduates, high school students, and parents to advocate for these changes. The Petition Colleges and universities could save students billions of dollars a year on textbooks by adopting these policies. We call on them to: Consider the cost when selecting textbooks. Use free Open Source textbooks whenever possible. Do not require university-specific editions or (unless essential) the latest edition, which undermine the used book market. Refrain from requiring students to purchase expensive access codes for homework assignments and quizzes. Tell students what textbooks are required and what they cost before registration begins so they have time to shop for savings. Have college bookstores transparently serve students, rather than profit off of them. Inform students of scholarships to fund textbooks. Have college libraries put enough textbooks on reserve for in-house use. Support book exchanges for students to trade used books. Establish a standing student-faculty committee dedicated to this issue. A Nonprofit Movement Free The Textbooks is a nonprofit movement. We are glad to help you receive college credit for this internship. Use Your Skills in Communications and Public Relations Communications is, of course, a key element in growing the movement. We need to reach national media, student media, student organizations, social media channels, and others to raise word of the problem and of our solution.

A pioneering nonprofit, Heifer International, has shown that nonprofits can capture some of that money by making donations, given in a friend&rsquo;s name, feel like a present. It works! They raise $115 million a year this way. Imagine how much more gift money could be captured by nonprofits addressing popular causes, including your favorites. The challenge is that it is too daunting for most nonprofits to provide a gift-like experience: tangible donation opportunities, wish lists, gift registries, and personalized printed greeting cards. About www.ChangingThePresent.org Our nonprofit site provides a gift-like experience, which helps 400 leading nonprofits capture money normally spent on traditional presents. The NY Times called it an \\\"amazon.com of the nonprofit world.\\\" We are now about to invite all million nonprofits to join the site. We are also providing each with their own private, charitable gift sites so they can send supporters without exposing them to other nonprofits. See a sample: http://SampleNGO.GiftsForHumanity.org.

We offer four great benefits: Take on a leadership role Enhance your resume Make a difference Generate funds for college tuition and textbooks We are looking for passionate, energetic students with exceptional skills. This is an outstanding leadership opportunity in an innovative start-up nonprofit organization. About ClassWish ClassWish is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in NYC and working nationwide. Our initial focus was in providing resources for K-12 students. We are now turning attention to help generate funds for nonprofits and for college tuition and textbooks, as well. We offer high-achieving students unparalleled opportunities to assume responsibility, use their skills, gain experience, and make a difference--and provide relief from the cost of college tuition and textbooks. Here are the problems we are tackling: We are tackling two problems at once: Nonprofits need far more funding to fulfill their missions, and schools need far more resources for kids (books, computers, art supplies, musical instruments, science equipment, and sports equipment are all in desperately short supply). Students and their families are burdened by the skyrocketing cost of college tuition and textbooks. (By the way, be sure to see www.TuitionRevolution.org). Our Approach ClassWish is launching a new initiative to address these needs. Soon, students and their families will be able to earn an average of 8% of what they spend at stores, grocers, gas stations, restaurants, hotels, and airlines, and they will be able to direct that to their favorite schools, teachers, nonprofits, or even their own tuition and textbooks. What Campus Reps Will Do ClassWish Campus Reps will help raise awareness of this opportunity for students, professors, and their families to generate funding for schools, nonprofits, and college tuition.

One benefit that will be of special interest to the students in China is the opportunity to improve their resume with the addition of a responsible Community Service position that will help them gain admittance to American colleges.

We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your resum\u00e9, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions.

We are engaging with the Fashion industry, as follows: We will invite famous fashion designers to participate in the celebrity section of ClassWish. They will get their own page, where they can lend their voice to providing children with art suppleis and other resources; honor their own favorite teacher; and link to other fashion icons who are doing the same. They will also appear on web banner ads that we design specifically for each of them. We will secure donated ad inventory from fashion magazines, websites, blogs, schools, and retailers. The ClassWish PSA ads will feature the celebrities involved in the program. We will build Cause Marketing and promotional campaigns with fashion brands and retailers. For instance, we are working on one campaign now: 'Win a wardrobe for yourself and one for your favorite teacher.&rsquo; We will seek editorial coverage of the campaign from fashion magazines and websites. We will use social media to reinforce these campaigns. We are a small organization, so we seek outstanding students who can take a leadership role.

Internship in NYC We seek an outstanding undergraduate or graduate student as a bookkeeping intern for the current school year and for the summer to collaborate on the boldest nonprofit initiative we know.

We are looking for entrepreneurial, passionate, and energetic students with exceptional skills to take initiative on a range of projects. This is an outstanding leadership opportunity in an innovative, emerging nonprofit. Here is the problem we are tackling: K-12 schools in this country do not have enough resources to let children explore their potential and excel.

Our Approach: ClassWish.org, an exciting new nonprofit, uses modern business practices and the latest marketing techniques to help 125,000 schools serving 56 million kids, inform, inspire and engage supporters. Teachers visit the site to create Wish Lists of the resources they need. People in the community can see exactly what is needed and contribute to help.

FAQ - Review ClassWish.org&rsquo;s outstanding internship program here: Is this a business or a nonprofit? We are a nonprofit, but we use the latest techniques from the business world to make a leveraged, scalable and financially-self sustaining difference in the lives of tens of millions of schoolchildren. This sounds ambitious! Daniel Burnham, the great Chicago architect, said \\\"Make no little plans; they have not the power to stir men&rsquo;s souls.\\\" (Nor women&rsquo;s, we hasten to add). Little plans also do not have the power to provide a better education to 56 million kids who deserve more than they are getting today. We face a crushing need in schools, have a solid plan to address it, and with your help, we intend to grow this very large and very fast. Where are you located? We are in Manhattan, conveniently located right across from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. Four express subway stops, LIRR, and the PATH train are all within one block. We will also hire interns to work remotely from other cities (but for other roles, not bookkeeping). What skills and experience are you looking for? This posting is for a bookkeeping intern. We also seek interns with a wide range of skills: graphic designers, videographers, writers, researchers, creative thinkers, analytical sorts, community organizers, social media stars, people with great communication skills, MBA students, and more. I looked at your site and have some suggestions. Great! This is a collaborative project, and we want to hear from you. Your ClassWish review will be helpful. Is this a paid internship? We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your rsum, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions. Do check to see if your school offers a stipend program. When will you select the interns? We&rsquo;re agile. When we see a great candidate, we extend an invitation immediately. We won&rsquo;t keep you waiting for a decision. What dates will the internship run? We are flexible. Tell us what you are looking for. What are the hours? We welcome full-time and part-time interns.

Here is the problem we are tackling: K-12 schools in this country do not have enough resources to let children explore their potential and excel. Books, computers, art supplies, musical instruments, science equipment, sports equipment, and even paper for computers and printers are all in desperately short supply. Our Approach: ClassWish.org, an exciting new nonprofit, uses modern business practices and the latest marketing techniques to help 125,000 schools serving 56 million kids, inform, inspire and engage supporters. Teachers visit the site to create Wish Lists of the resources they need. People in the community can see exactly what is needed and contribute to help. About Us: The people behind ClassWish.org include such prominent education and business leaders as Adam Hirsch, former COO, Mashable; Laurie Coots, CMO, TBWA; Scott Cutler, EVP, New York Stock Exchange; Betsy Morgan, former CEO, Huffington Post; Nancy Pelz-Paget, Director, Education and Society Program, Aspen Institute; Sharon Robinson, CEO, American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education. Forbes Magazine liked our approach so much that they donated a full page to help raise awareness. Yo-Yo Ma, Tony Hawk and Dwight Howard are among the celebrities who have offered to help promote ClassWish.org. The work: Teachers and students are already getting supplies from ClassWish.org. Now, we need to raise greater awareness and encourage more participation so we can help more kids. Volunteers work individually and in small teams focused on such things as: * Marketing to particular audiences, such as businesses, bloggers, press, educators, moms, religious organizations, civic organizations, unions, nonprofits, authors, soap operas, magazine readers, teens and celebrities. * Marketing around particular school subjects, such as science, music, art, reading and sports * Marketing around particular promotions (such as http://ClassWish.org/fido and http://ClassWish.org/books/124). * Creating and implementing social media campaigns * Building and managing relationships with strategic partners such as http://EdRover.com. * Building and leading a national network of volunteers. * Enhancing the website. * Creating graphics and promotional materials. You will take leadership on projects and work with other highly motivated volunteers, interns, established professionals, and directly with our co-founder. What do we offer? You will enhance your resume with a solid record of professional achievement and community service, and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you have helped children get the tools they need to perform at their best. If you want a great experience doing something you will always be proud of, send a cover letter and a resume to volunteers@ClassWish.org. FAQ Is this a business or a nonprofit?

RSVP for our Information Session for Video Professionals! (See RSVP details below!) Our goal is to put together a volunteer team that can edit the groundbreaking work being done at The Actors Theatre Workshop. Using your professional skills to edit this wonderful material will surely stimulate hope, excitement and I believe bring true enlightenment to those who participate. At the same time you will reach another dimension in your craft as you learn about the unique filming/editing perspective of the ATW Founder and Artistic Director, Thurman E. Scott. ATW has long been on the front lines of disciplined creative training for theater professionals and individuals committed to fulfilling their creative potential. ATW has also been a safe haven for thousands of at-risk and homeless youth. The original theater and educational technique which has been tremendously successful with our professional acting students, has proven to be equally beneficial to the children we teach in our after-school programs. We have many years of footage from our adult acting workshop's and community program's that we want to share with you and the world. We've started sharing this video online and we've received such positive feedback from every corner of the globe that we are taking steps to put out more. This process takes time and so we would like to find more dedicated individuals who want to learn and make a difference in other people's lives and be a part of something hopeful by joining our video editing team. Our editors often talk about the beautiful, inspiring and deeply moving moments they have witnessed when a student actor or a child from a homeless shelter brings forth his talent and reaches for their potential. You literally see the moments when there is a shift in consciousness and they begin to accept their strength and the unique gifts that they have to offer the world. And in that moment you know that this person has changed forever-- and as a result undoubtedly so have you. By working directly with this material you will gain deep insight into the emotional and psychological breakdown of drama, and learn to see the penetrating insights that come out of script analysis, which gives you the ability to find and understand the eternal essence of ideas that are then formulated into a universal idea that helps to instill faith and spread hope to all individuals on a creative journey. So without further ado.. We invite you to a Volunteer Info Session for video editing professionals .To RSVP go to: http://www.actorstheatreworkshop.com, click on \\\"volunteers\\\" and fill out an online application.

This is an intensive Leadership Training Program in non-profit business management. Interns receive hands-on training as a management assistant. If skilled in video, interns may assist in video production and editing at our award-winning theater arts and community service organization. As video production becomes increasingly critical to the growth, development and success of managing a successful non-profit, we seek intern candidates that are leaders who are passionate about non-profit management and posses skills in video production and editing. Successful non-profits are built on powerful ideas that inspire hope. These ideas are manifested in the programs and the management of the organization. By gaining a working understanding of how to successfully manage a nonprofit organization, the intern begins to learn its core principals, which allows the intern to begin to take a leadership role in the organization. In addition, this knowledge is invaluable in the creation of videos that effectively promote and bring this work to the world. These videos are essential to the marketing and fund-raising efforts in any successful non-profit. We are looking for individuals with the ability to lead, manage teams, work independently, communicate effectively on the phone, in person and in writing and interact in a fast-paced business environment. We are looking for idealists and leaders who can put their thoughts and insights into action; positive, enthusiastic individuals who want to make a difference in the world and are committed to upholding the legacy and tradition of theater in the belief that theater can change a life and make the world a better place for everyone. The interns' primary responsibility is to manage the daily administrative operations of the organization and to take a leadership role in programming initiatives. There will be opportunities to work closely with the senior staff: in administrating over workshops for actors and community programs that serve Youth-at-Risk and homeless children. Under ATW supervision, interns will be accountable for projects in the management of ATW's studio rental business, administration, team management, marketing, development, sales, fund-raising, video production, event planning, and graphic design.

We seek applicants with training and experience logging footage, editing in Final Cut Pro, http streaming, digital shooting, lighting, sound and web design and development. Interns and Volunteers consistently report they gain tremendously from filming and reviewing footage of ATW classes and workshops and have benefited as if they had actually taken the classes themselves. In summary, we seek professional, detail-oriented individuals who are positive and curious, with a desire to learn and engage in a process. The Actors Theatre Workshop is an award-winning non-profit theater, educational institution and community center in NYC founded by award-winning actor, director, writer and producer, Thurman E.

It is the most extensive outreach program in New York City covering specific Manhattan based locations, i.e. Grand Central Station, Penn Station and Port Authority Bus Terminal, 5 days per week in vans and on foot. Outreach staff and volunteers engages homeless individuals with the goal of assessing each individual's situation and needs and providing each client with an accessible doorway to services they need. Clients are afforded referral, transportation and placement at the resource deemed most beneficial to the individual, and each is treated with respect, professionalism and informed guidance. The Outreach Team encounters many individuals that are reluctant to use services or have found the available resources unmanageable and overwhelming. These clients are provided with counseling, information and advocacy in pursuing services, rights and resources. Every individual engaged is given the opportunity to access the services most suited to their needs. Working with Outreach staff, volunteers will help refer clients to assessment shelters, drop-in centers, drug and alcohol treatment, psychiatric and medical facilities, job training centers and entitlement offices.

Volunteer Kenya / ICODEI is a non-religious, non-political volunteer organization run through a partnership of past overseas volunteers and local Kenyans. Our Microenterprise Development Program is our newest program. We have been active in helping set up small income-generating activities (IGA) for rural self-help groups since the early 2000's (primarily thru grants), but only recently began focusing our work on providing more advice, consulting assistance, and small loans to the groups. MDP volunteers work with the existing microenterprise groups to help them grow and improve their existing projects, as well as help newly forming groups start an IGA. The 5 main areas of volunteer activity in the MDP are as follows: \u2022 Progress Assessment \u2022 Facilitate a Group Project Discussion / Evaluation and Provide Project Advice \u2022 Facilitate Knowledge and Resource Sharing Within the Network of Groups \u2022 Provide Small Loans \u2022 Provide General Business Skills Training Seminars Most volunteers spend their time doing a combination of all the above 5 items. Our value-added is not just in the form of providing financial resources (loans) but includes project planning advice, basic management and accounting training, and (very importantly) volunteers act as facilitators between our vast network of groups in order to facilitate knowledge and resource sharing among the groups. Our pilot microlending program has just gotten off the ground during the last several months and we currently have about $10,000 USD in outstanding loans. The MDP volunteers will be spending a lot of their time over the next several months meeting with the loans groups to ensure that are on schedule with paying back their loans and that they are investing their money prudently (e.g., in productivity enhancing resources versus consumption items). As the loans are repaid, the volunteers then give them out in the form of new loans to other groups. We have a very large backlog of loan application requests. As a volunteer in the MDP you would spend the vast majority of your time out in the field meeting and working with the women microenterprise groups, which is a very rewarding and educational experience. All of the microenterprise groups within our network are independent groups. We do not manage their day to day operations and do not charge any type of fee for our services. We are a strict volunteer non-for-profit organization. All interest that we receive from the microloans goes towards new loans for additional groups. We are now have a network of around 100 microenterprise groups within the western Kenya region. As of June 2007, our organization has had over 350 volunteers since 1998 from over 6 different countries. Volunteers in our Microenterprise Development have come from a variety of backgrounds including undergrad business students (Duke, Rice, Miami, Indiana), MBA and graduate students on their summer break (Stanford, Penn, etc.), management consultants (BCG, McKinsey, CRA), retired professionals, and accountants.

Sprout is a non-profit organization based in New York City focused on providing innovative programs for adults with developmental disabilities.With our network of resources and dedicated volunteers, which we call leaders, Sprout opens up fascinating new worlds to people with disabilities. Sprout's Overnight Vacations Program is looking for individuals who have the energy, motivation and desire to work with adults with developmental disabilities. What do Sprout leaders do? Sprout leaders' primary goal is to give adults with developmental disabilities the opportunity to experience and enjoy recreational, educational and leisure activities through overnight vacations. Leaders are responsible for the overall safety and enjoyment of their group, 24 hours a day, while on a Sprout trip. Duties include safety monitoring, personal hygiene assistance, providing physical and emotional support, activity planning, budgeting, logistics, and enhancing fun. The work is hard yet immensely rewarding as you develop leadership skills and gain insight into your own abilities. What type of training is provided? Leaders must complete a pre-service training, which provides the necessary procedures and tools to run a successful and enjoyable vacation. Leaders who are drivers receive extra training on how to safely drive our 15-passenger vans. In addition, all leaders receive a copy of Sprout's Leadership Handbook to help with policies and guidelines. What is the time commitment? Sprout vacations last 3 - 7 days depending on the time of year and destination of the trip. When a leader is selected for an overnight vacation, Sprout asks that the leader dedicate themselves to stay with their group throughout the entire duration of the vacation. Some leaders only choose to lead one trip a year while others spend several months with us leading up to 8 trips or more. Sprout strives to make our program flexible for our leaders based on the amount of time leaders can give. Do leaders have any free or personal time while on a trip? Sprout trips are working vacations for the leaders who choose to participate. Because Sprout leaders are responsible for their group 24 hours a day, there is no free or personal time allotted. In order to give our participants the opportunity to experience and enjoy a vacation, Sprout leaders must be available at all times to provide the support any one participant may need. What type of trips can Sprout leaders expect to join? A majority of Sprout trips take place within a day's drive of New York City. Destinations include Atlantic City, Amish Country, Boston, Lake George, Cleveland, Maine and Virginia Beach. Exotic trips like cruises, Hawaii, and Europe are presented to leaders who have demonstrated high levels of commitment, service hours and have gained positive feedback from participants and Sprout office staff. Are there any special skills or requirements? No special background or education is required to become a Sprout leader. We encourage people from all cultures and professions, and of all ethnic and educational backgrounds. Once accepted into the program, you will receive the necessary tools to sign up for outings and how to assist our participants. Requirements include: -21+ years old -Provide references -Participate in training session -Willingness to complete necessary background checks -Evaluate participants' behavior -Fluent English -Willing to drive a 15 passenger van -Love to travel & have fun!

It's easy for you to get involved and help save more animals simply by driving a leg in this relay. How it works: Click the I WANT TO HELP button. When an animal rescue organization posts a transport request, we will search to see if it matches your profile (if you're available and within the distance) and then send you an e-mail. Then you simply click on the leg that you can cover and everyone else will see that you've signed up for that leg. You'll get communications from the transport coordinator and, once the transport is a \\\"go\\\", you simply drive to the meeting place, load up the animals, and drive them to the next meeting place to hand them off to the next volunteer. You'll get plenty of doggy kisses and thank you's along the way as the animals know you are there to help them.

Our New York program workshops take place in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Career Coaches work with college students during Saturday sessions to build their professional skills and help them realize their career potential. ANY curriculum covers all kinds of professional development topics from resume preparation and interview etiquette to giving and receiving feedback and managing up. At workshops, Career Coaches typically participate in group or one-on-one work with Fellows; for example, writing and reviewing a cover letter or building a pros/cons list for deciding between two internships.

Volunteer Kenya - ICODEI is a non-religious, non-political volunteer organization run through a partnership of past overseas volunteers and local Kenyans. Our Microenterprise Development Program is our newest program. We have been active in helping set up small income-generating activities (IGA) for rural self-help groups since the early 2000's (primarily thru grants), but only recently began focusing our work on providing more advice, consulting assistance, and small loans to the groups. MDP volunteers work with the existing microenterprise groups to help them grow and improve their existing projects, as well as help newly forming groups start an IGA. The 5 main areas of volunteer activity in the MDP are as follows: \u2022 Progress Assessment \u2022 Facilitate a Group Project Discussion / Evaluation and Provide Project Advice \u2022 Facilitate Knowledge and Resource Sharing Within the Network of Groups \u2022 Provide Small Loans \u2022 Provide General Business Skills Training Seminars Most volunteers spend their time doing a combination of all the above 5 items. Our value-added is not just in the form of providing financial resources (loans) but includes project planning advice, basic management and accounting training, and (very importantly) volunteers act as facilitators between our vast network of groups in order to facilitate knowledge and resource sharing among the groups. Our pilot microlending program has just gotten off the ground during the last several months and we currently have about $10,000 USD in outstanding loans. The MDP volunteers will be spending a lot of their time over the next several months meeting with the loans groups to ensure that are on schedule with paying back their loans and that they are investing their money prudently (e.g., in productivity enhancing resources versus consumption items). As the loans are repaid, the volunteers then give them out in the form of new loans to other groups. We have a very large backlog of loan application requests. As a volunteer in the MDP you would spend the vast majority of your time out in the field meeting and working with the women microenterprise groups, which is a very rewarding and educational experience. All of the microenterprise groups within our network are independent groups. We do not manage their day to day operations and do not charge any type of fee for our services. We are a strict volunteer non-for-profit organization. All interest that we receive from the microloans goes towards new loans for additional groups. We are now have a network of around 100 microenterprise groups within the western Kenya region. As of June 2007, our organization has had over 350 volunteers since 1998 from over 6 different countries. Volunteers in our Microenterprise Development have come from a variety of backgrounds including undergrad business students (Duke, Rice, Miami, Indiana), MBA and graduate students on their summer break (Stanford, Penn, etc.), management consultants (BCG, McKinsey, CRA), retired professionals, and accountants.

Don't Walk By is a project of the Rescue Alliance, a coalition of faith-based organizations, including The Salvation Army, engaged in addressing homelessness and housing fragility. Each Saturday in February, in one of four sections of Manhattan per Saturday (uptown, eastside, westside, and downtown), volunteer teams walk the streets and subways of an assigned area engaging with homeless neighbors they may encounter distributing small items (eg. hygiene kits, clean socks, etc.) and extending an invitation to dinner at an anchor church. If accepted, guests are offered a van trip to the church. At the anchor church, guests are provided a dignified sit-down dinner (eg. tablecloths, centerpieces, printed menus, servers, etc.). Every guest is invited to spend the evening housed in a Rescue Alliance member/partner shelter (eg. NYC Rescue Mission, All Angels' Church). Our hope is that accepting this offer will lead to longer-term case management, the end goal being life-transformation that includes dignity, stable housing, independence, and, where needed, sobriety. In addition to a meal and invitation to shelter, other services provided at the anchor church include: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit sign-up Distribution of backpacks, winter coats, SafeLink cell phones, and other items Legal advice Medical services including HIV testing, optometry w/ free glasses, podiatry, blood pressure checks, etc. Referrals to detox, drug and alcohol rehabilitation, and mental health services This year, The Salvation Army is the lead coordinator of this outreach working with multiple Rescue Alliance members/partners (eg. Bowery Mission, Hope For New York, NYC Relief, New York Presbyterian Hospital, etc.) each taking lead over several included functions.

This is a great opportunity for students who are majoring (or have already earned a degree) in the course area to enhance their knowledge and experience and who are interested in tutoring. In this role, you would collaborate with an instructor to improve students&rsquo; performance while being supported and guided by an experienced academic support professional. The embedded tutor for this College Now class is expected to commit a minimum of four hours Saturdays per class session. You would identify and support students who are struggling, participate during the lecture to augment the class topic discussions, and provide feedback to the instructor regarding students' concerns and difficulties that can lead to changes in future lessons. You might also design assignments, identify/track students who are struggling and create differentiated instruction as the need arises. You will be supported throughout this process by the City Tutors staff. All embedded tutors are also expected to complete a five session comprehensive professional training regimen. Training days will be determined based on your schedule and that of the Tutor Training Coordinators. CT's embedded tutoring program has been successful in helping students gain access to support that they otherwise would not have received, given their limited time spent on campus. Having a tutor in the class early in the semester will allow us to employ strategies to reduce withdrawals and student failure rates. Your work with us would help the students&rsquo; overall subject area performance, and help us improve this educational support model, reaching more students and departments with comprehensive academic support.

Volunteers assist with welcoming families and assisting them in using the computers, giving directions, visiting the units to distribute books and other materials and assisting the Health Librarian and Administrative Assistant with various clerical duties as well as with projects that we are working on. We look forward to hearing from you!
