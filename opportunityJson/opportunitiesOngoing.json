Have you ever wanted to do something AMAZING to change the world but didn't know where to start? Here is an opportunity to help underprivileged children, to help under-served children, to help ALL children displaced from school due to COVID-19, and even to help many adults who can't read. We are looking for three, very special people, who have the skills, expertise, experience, passion, and time to be part of something amazing that is about to fundamentally change the lives of millions of children. Right now, millions of children have no hope; but soon, they will have the opportunity to learn how to read, which, in turn, will open a window to education and to a world of potential for them that, not only, has never been opened before, but that has never even been seriously contemplated as a potential reality. What we are talking about is an adaptive learning, gamified smartphone app, called FUNetix, that can literally, teach a child how to read, in the comfort of their home, in an average of just 12 hours of total use time! We are the American Youth Literacy Foundation, and we have been teaching children how to read for nearly 12 years! We have been developing this app for about two years, and this year we will launch this incredible smartphone app in the App Store and on Google Play by Thanksgiving, 2020, to help save millions of children from a lifetime of illiteracy! Already, there are millions of children who are struggling to learn how to read. Already, there are millions more who have given up on reading and are destined to go through life either completely illiterate, or with semi-literate skills at best. And now with the displacement of tens of millions of children from school, for an indeterminate amount of time , the loss of reading capacity of the next generation presents a new, crisis moment in American education \u00c2 and a very real threat to the future success of millions of young students. We are partnered with an engineering team that was one of the five $1 million finalists in the XPrize for Global Learning competition (the winners of which were announced this past May), which was a worldwide competition for app \\\"design and development\\\" teams from around the world to design, build and deliver a tablet-based app to children in remote villages in Africa which could teach them how to read and do basic math (children of all ages, most of whom had never been to school before in their lives). The curriculum that our app is based on is a patented reading decoding system, and is so effective at teaching children how to read, that it usually only takes 4-6 hours for them to understand the basic learning tools, and another 4-6 hours for them to reach a 2nd grade reading level. Compare this to so many of our students who have been in the public school system for 6 years and still can't spell the word \\\"the.\\\" Compare this to millions of students who have dropped out of school, primarily because they can't read (more than 10 million per decade). More than 20 million children in grades 3-12 in America's public schools today can't read! Our organization is an 11 year old, nationwide, charitable 501 c 3 non-profit. We started out as a tutoring program and we still provide one-on-one tutoring. But our focus has always been on finding a scalable solution to the literacy crisis in America. With the rise of the smartphone and the amazing penetration of this powerful tool (currently estimated at 80%), even into the most impoverished communities, we feel that the answer we have been searching for IS in the form of an app. So for the past several years we have been working to convert our amazing reading curriculum, that teaches children how to read in an average of just 12 hours, into an app that teaches children how to read in about the same time. And this is where you come in. The App is comprised of approximately 2,000 unique screens, each of which is fully narrated. After the child learns the fundamentals of letters and sounds and how to blend sound symbols to form words and sentences (using a super-child-friendly, phonetic code called 21E), we transition them to English, where we utilize our patented diacritic decoding system to introduce them to the irregular letter patterns found in English spelling. From there, we continue to increase students' awareness of the various letter patterns and combinations, while simultaneously introducing them to more and more complex sentences, stories and interactive, fiction and non-fiction content. As students progress in their reading capability, we begin to introduce primers, books, stories, games, puzzles and other content that will be embedded within the learning modules AND that children will have access to in our \\\"Wonderful Content Library\\\" that is unlocked after they have finished the 12-hour structured curriculum. There's much more to tell. You can read more about our story and about us on our website at www.FUNetix.org and at www.YouthLit.org . We are looking for some very special people who have the passion, time, and especially, the illustration skills needed to help us populate our proprietary reading materials child-friendly, colorful, happy, creative and otherwise wonderful drawings that potentially millions of children will see on their path to learning how to read. If you wish to be considered for this opportunity to be one of volunteer children&rsquo;s book illustrators, please send us a sample of your artwork by replying to this listing. When you reply you will receive an auto-reply email containing an attached pdf. Follow the instructions on the pdf to illustrate ONLY ONE of the two story samples. (Each sample contains 2 screens, so you will be illustrating 2 screens from the same story.) Send your samples to info@FUNetix.org and we will respond to you if we choose your illustration. EVEN IF we don&rsquo;t choose you to illustrate one of the sample stories, we may still contact you to illustrate one of our many other stories or books.

Thank you! We hope this opportunity finds you at the right place and the right time to make a difference and an impact, in an amazing way, for millions of children who are waiting for someone, or something, to lead them out of a life of impoverishment and into a future of unlimited possibility and potential through literacy.

Rescues and Shelters use Doobert.com to create their transport requests to get the animals where they need to go.

Is your child an emerging reader in 1st, 2nd or 3rd grade who is on the path to reading, but isn&rsquo;t quite there yet? Now you can do something incredible to help your child, to help your family, and to help potentially millions of children and millions of families across the country, by teaching your child how to read in 12 hours using the FUNetix Literacy App, and by providing us with critical \\\"user feedback\\\" as part of our Advanced Product Trials. Imagine that your child could be reading within 12 hours of starting the FUNetix app. They can finish the school year on a strong, positive note, and they can continue reading throughout the summer, getting ready for their next grade level! The American Youth Literacy Foundation is a nationwide 501 (c) (3), charitable non-profit, founded in 2008 and dedicated to bringing literacy to ALL children by the time they finish 3rd grade. For the past 12 years, we have worked with thousands of children of all abilities across the country, teaching them how to read. We&rsquo;ve been able to identify and resolve the root cause of the reading problem. And we&rsquo;ve unlocked the \\\"secret code\\\" that enables kids to learn how to read incredibly quickly, and with a deep understanding of fundamental reading principles. After tens of thousands of hours working with children from all socio-economic backgrounds (and all reading abilities) across the country, we have developed and patented a reading curriculum called FUNetix. For 12 years we have been using this patented curriculum to teach children how to read. And for the past 4 years we have been translating our instructional games and activities into an app. We began building our app long before the Coronavirus ever hit, and we will be teaching children long after the Coronavirus leaves; but for right now, we are doing our final preparations to bring the app to the App Store and Google Play by Thanksgiving, 2020. By participating in our advanced product trials, you will be able to access the app before anyone else. We are inviting up to 1,000 people to download and play the entire app and provide critical feedback to us so that we can make our final decisions on how to optimize the user experience (UX) ahead of our launch. By using the FUNetix app, your child will learn ALL 44 sounds of the English language . They will learn how to blend sounds and sound symbols together to form words, using a \\\"Secret Code\\\" called 21E(r). They will learn all of this in about 4 hours. Then they will begin reading English words using our patented system of diacritics, which are special, child friendly sound symbols that show your child how to pronounce ANY English word. It takes about another 4 hours to begin mastering this special pronunciation guide. Then your child will spend another 4 hours of the app practicing, by playing games and reading stories, and receiving additional instruction, in order to build their skills and their confidence. After about 12 hours of total instruction time, your child will gain access to an entire library of wonderful content, including books, games, puzzles, poems, stories and treasure hunts. As they work their way through the many varied reading options, they will always have a simple button to push when they want to see, for example, how a new word is pronounced. They simply push the FUNetix button within the game or story and the diacritics magically appear. We call this button, the \\\"Magic Decoder.\\\" But you can only use the \\\"Magic Decoder\\\" if you know the \\\"Secret Code.\\\" Children who know the Secret Code can push the Magic Decoder button whenever they want to unlock the pronunciation of ANY English word. That&rsquo;s FUNetix! Your child will come out of the app reading at about a 2nd grade level, and they will be ready to accelerate at lightning speed into all things written, including books, stories, and grade level course material. If your child is already in 3rd grade or higher, they will now have the fundamental reading skills they need to quickly catch up to their grade level course material. The app works because it teaches \\\"phonological (sound) awareness\\\" FIRST, allowing the developing brain to create a \\\"neural map\\\" of the 44 unique sounds of English via the use of child-friendly, pictograms, or, \\\"sound symbols.\\\" The app works because it first shows children that each sound can be represented as a symbol; and then it shows children that these sound symbols can be blended together to form the very same words that we use in our everyday conversations. Children begin to recognize that sound symbols are the pictorial representations of our spoken language, and the fundamental building blocks of written code. The app works because it introduces English much later in the reading process (4 hours later). English spelling patterns like \\\"ee\\\" and \\\"ea,\\\" etc. are equated to one of the 44 building blocks of sound that the student is now already familiar with. When the app introduces English, it does so by showing children ALL of the pieces of a given word and how the sound of each piece (\\\"phonics\\\") is easily revealed by the Magic Decoder (the diacritic symbols they already know, strategically positioned above the word.) The app works because it teaches ALL of the fundamentals of reading in the RIGHT order. And the app works because it provides children with a \\\"touch of the button\\\" pronunciation guide, and teaches them how to interpret that pronunciation guide. It&rsquo;s like a set of training wheels. Children learn using the diacritics, but once they have seen a word a few times, they no longer need them. By the end of the app, children are essentially weaned off of the diacritics except where new, \\\"novel\\\" words are introduced, words that they have never seen before. For new words, students always have the FUNetix button available so they never have to ask a parent or teacher or older sibling how to decode it. They can do it themselves! And if it&rsquo;s a word they already know the meaning of, they immediately make the association and UNDERSTAND the context in which it is being used. So if you have 12 hours that you would like to donate to this cause, we are looking for up to 1,000 early users. We hope that you and your child have an incredible experience learning how to read with the patented \\\"FUNetix 12 Hour Literacy App!\\\" And we hope that your child becomes a lifelong reader like so many other children who have learned how to read using the FUNetix curriculum. And we hope that your candid feedback will help us make this app as fun and interesting and enjoyable as possible for millions of children who will use it after Thanksgiving, 2020. And of course this is all FREE. We are a 501 (c) (3) charitable non-profit, and we are giving this app away to the world, for FREE! That&rsquo;s our purpose and our mission!

We welcome your gifts of time and compassion. Whether you choose to work directly with patients and families or to volunteer in one of many other ways, you can make a profound difference in someone's life, including your own. Volunteers are an integral part of the hospice team. Volunteers are needed in all areas of NJ! Volunteer Opportunities: Companionship Volunteers work directly with patients providing companionship, offering friendly visits, reading to patients, writing letters, offering a gentle touch or sharing a quiet moment. Complementary Volunteers are certified/trained professionals who can provide complementary modalities of reflexology, music, imagery and touch therapies such as Reiki, massage, therapeutic touch and healing hands. Pet Therapy Volunteers provide certified/trained pets who visit with patients. These animals provide loving memories for some and give unconditional love helping our patients feel connected to a larger world. Administrative Volunteers provide help to the staff in our Edison office by assisting with typing, addressing cards, organizing newsletters, creating packets, collating manuals and other varied clerical duties Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, huggable dolls/bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Junior Volunteers consist of groups such as girl/boy scouts or young people who wish to honor our patients by making holiday cards, posters, wall hangings and memory books. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families and friends of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network. Hospice training classes are required for Companionship and Complementary Volunteers. They are free of charge and offered on an ongoing basis. Grace Healthcare Services serves counties throughout New Jersey. Areas where you are needed include: Atlantic County, Bergen County, Cape May County, Essex County, Hudson County, Mercer County, Middlesex County, Monmouth County, Morris County, North Passaic County, Ocean County, Somerset County, South Passaic County, Burlington County, Camden County and Union County.

The Comprehensive Community Hospice Program of Parker Jewish Institute is looking for people who would like to volunteer as a doula, going out to patients' homes and extending the hand of reassurance, offering a smile that warms the heart, and the words that say everything will be okay. Volunteer Doulas will help patients and families cope with the process of dying, remaining at the bedside as life ends. \\\"Doula\\\" is a Greek word that means \\\"woman servant or caregiver.\\\" Today it is associated with individuals who provide physical assistance and emotional support during and/or after childbirth. This proposed program aims to mirror the concept by providing the same type of support at the final phase of a terminal illness. This initiative will place a focus on planning for death with the elderly patient and family if there is one, and will provide a continuous around the clock vigil as death becomes imminent. The program will help the elderly patient who lacks family or adequate caregiver support to die comfortably, without fear of being alone. Even when surrounded by loved ones, individuals with a terminal illness and those closest to them may feel isolated as they face the end of life. As the end of life approaches, patients and families struggle with anxiety and fear; exhaustion; loved ones often feel alone, unprepared and afraid; and opportunities to explore meaning go unaddressed. Hospice Doulas provide emotional support and comfort to patients and their loved ones in the final phase of a terminal illness. Our End-of-Life (EOL) Doula volunteers will receive thorough training in understanding the dying process and in the skills that help bring peace and comfort to all involved. This free two-day training includes learning how to do guided visualization, help create rituals, provide simple physical support, offer sacred presence, as well as how to create spiritual and emotional legacies. Parker Jewish institute will be hosting a free two-day Doula training workshop on Saturday 10/28/17 and Sunday 10/29/17 from 9:00am-6:00pm. Breakfast and lunch will be served. A certificate will be awarded upon completion of this workshop. If you are interested in attending, please call the Hospice Program's Volunteer Doula Coordinator at 718-289-2134, or email volunteer-nerken@parkerinstitute.org. Doulas can come from any background and no experience is required. They typically work in as part of a team.

Hospice volunteers can commit to as little or as much time as they wish. Some volunteers provide several hours of service each week while others commit to a few hours each month. Serving as valued members of the hospice team, for just a few hours of your time you can make a significant impact on the lives of patients and their loved ones. There are many opportunities to share your time and talents as a volunteer and support patients, their loved ones dealing with end of life. Opportunities include: Hospice Doulas Bereavement/Grief Patient Friendly Visits Legacy Projects Administrative Support Community Education Help Recruiting Other Volunteers Note: We ask that those who have recently lost a loved one wait a year before becoming a hospice volunteer. You are welcome to participate in our bereavement programs during this time. All hospice volunteers receive extensive training. Depending the type of volunteering, training is can range from 6-18 hours. All volunteers must complete our new volunteer orientation.

Junior Volunteers consist of groups such as girl/boy scouts or young people who wish to honor our patients by making holiday cards, posters, wall hangings and memory books.

Volunteer Musicians play one song per room and interact with patients, their families and hospital staff. All lyrics MUST be appropriate for a hospital setting, therefore MOC provides an approved song list for musicians to select their repertoire for hospital visits. Any other material outside of the approved song list may be submitted to MOC staff for approval. Musician applicants must also submit a sample of their music prior to acceptance into the program. Volunteer Musicians must complete MOC's training process which is outlined below. Guides Volunteer Guides escort Volunteer Musicians from room to room as they play music for patients. Volunteer Guides knock on each hospital room door and ask patients if they feel like hearing music. They also introduce the musicians prior to their performances and guide them through the facility. Each guide is assigned to a specific healthcare facility. The Volunteer Guide is the \\\"eyes and ears\\\" of MOC during the Bedside Performance Program as well as the liaison between the hospital and the Volunteer Musician.

All volunteering is via the computer -- you can be anywhere in the world. The Daily Source is truly a 21st century journalism site. Our online software is incredibly easy to use and automates most of the layout process. Just drag and drop articles from one location to another and the page adjusts itself automatically. Editing the headlines is as easy as using Microsoft Word or sending an e-mail. You will receive guidance from our senior editors who are some of the top newspaper journalists in the U.S. Besides laying out the front page, you will find articles, videos, columns and other material from around the Internet for use on the site and make the final decision of what goes on the site. You will be doing real stuff that directly impacts our front page and our nonprofit's mission to help the world. You will also gain invaluable experience that will build your skills and look great on a resume. Some of our volunteers have gone on to work in the journalism field.

One of our editors was hired full-time by Wired.com and another was hired by Congress as the official congressional photographer of senators at public events. We have an extensive training process that is about a month long, so if we are going to train you, we need you to do a certain amount of hours in all to make it worth the time we put into it. Therefore, the Front Page Editor role is a minimum of 15 hours per week for a minimum of six months. If you can volunteer 20 hours or higher a week, then the minimum is only five months, or you can do 12 hours a week for seven and a half months. We tend to give preference to applicants who can do a sizable number of hours.

To view our front page, visit - http://dailysource.org/ To read more about us, view the links here - http://dailysource.org/about/site We usually also have the following openings (minimum hours per week and minimum number of months are in parenthesis). All these positions are telecommute so you don&rsquo;t have to drive or dress up, and can work from the comfort of your home. You might also be able to use our local Internet location, though there is some cost for that so virtual is preferred. If you apply for a position, you should view your commitment to it the same as if it were a paid position. We treat volunteers like normal staff and rely on them like staff. Our site is 99% volunteer run and we all depend on each other to make it a success. Please do not apply if you are viewing this opportunity as \\\"just a volunteer position\\\" and would treat it as less important than paid positions or other commitments you have. If you are in school, volunteering with us can function as an internship. Interns can usually receive credit with their school for their internships. Content Editor (10 hours a week for a minimum of 6 months): Searches the Internet for high quality articles, columns, editorials and videos, adds them to our system, and ranks them by quality. The front page editors pick from these to publish on the front page. Also does research and fact-checking when needed. This requires Internet surfing skills, strong understanding and judgment of the news, and attention to detail. Marketing and Social Media (6 hours a week for a minimum of 5 months): Help research potential media outlets and blogs to cover our site, e-mail our press releases to them, and keep track of coverage of our site that has occurred. We have a great website and need to get the word out about it. Help promote the website by updating our Facebook, Twitter and other social media pages, attracting new followers, and interacting with our existing followers.

Here is an opportunity to help underprivileged children, to help under-served children, to help ALL children displaced from school due to COVID-19, and even to help many adults who can't read. We are looking for three, very special people, who have the skills, expertise, experience, passion, and time to be part of something amazing that is about to fundamentally change the lives of millions of children. Right now, millions of children have no hope; but soon, they will have the opportunity to learn how to read, which, in turn, will open a window to education and to a world of potential for them that, not only, has never been opened before, but that has never even been seriously contemplated as a potential reality. What we are talking about is adaptive learning, gamified smartphone app, called FUNetix, that can literally, teach a child how to read, in the comfort of their home, in an average of just 12 hours of total use time! We are the American Youth Literacy Foundation, and we have been teaching children how to read for nearly 12 years! We have been developing this app for about two years, and this year we will launch this incredible smartphone app in the App Store and on Google Play by Thanksgiving, 2020, to help save millions of children from a lifetime of illiteracy! Already, there are millions of children who are struggling to learn how to read. Already, there are millions more who have given up on reading and are destined to go through life either completely illiterate, or with semi-literate skills at best. And now with the displacement of tens of millions of children from school, for an indeterminate amount of time , the loss of reading capacity of the next generation presents a new, crisis moment in American education , and a very real threat to the future success of millions of young students. We are partnered with an engineering team that was one of the five, $1 million finalists, in the XPrize for Global Learning competition (the winners of which were announced last May), which was a worldwide competition for app \\\"design and development\\\" teams to design, build and deliver a tablet-based app to children in remote villages in Africa which could teach them how to read and do basic math (children of all ages, most of whom had never been to school before in their lives). The curriculum that our app is based on is a patented reading decoding system , and is so effective at teaching children how to read, that it usually only takes 4-6 hours for them to understand the basic learning tools, and another 4-6 hours for them to reach a 2nd grade reading level. Compare this to so many of our students who have been in the public school system for 6 years and still can't spell simple words like \\\"the, said, was, would, could, there or which.\\\" Compare this to millions of students who have dropped out of school, primarily because they can't read (more than 10 million per decade (25% according to U.S. Government statistics)). More than 20 million children in grades 3-12 in America's public schools today are either completely or functionally illiterate, according to the U.S. Government&rsquo;s \\\"Annual Report Card.\\\" Our organization is a nearly 12 year old, nationwide, charitable 501 c 3 non-profit. We started out as a tutoring program in Philadelphia and central New Jersey, and we still provide one-on-one tutoring. But our focus has always been on finding a scalable solution to the literacy crisis in America. With the rise of the smartphone and the amazing penetration of this powerful tool (currently estimated at 80%), even into the most impoverished communities, we feel that the answer we have been searching for ABSOLUTELY comes in the form of an app. So for the past several years we have been working to convert our amazing reading curriculum, that teaches children how to read in an average of just 12 hours, into an app that teaches children how to read in about the same time. And this is where you come in. We have a LOT of opportunity in front of us to finish building and testing, and, ultimately, to deliver an end-user experience (the UX) to millions of children in America's inner cities and rural counties, in the barrios and the suburbs, and on the American Indian reservations, and everywhere in-between, with this smartphone app. But in order to do this, we need to complete three pieces of the equation: The Horse, The Cart, and the Payload. The Horse is the curriculum; and it is well under way in the conversion process from an analog to a digital curriculum. (We have designed already 1,500 of the nearly 2,000 screen, fully narrated, reading learning experience.) The Cart is the distribution system, the \\\"how do we get it out into communities and to the children, once it's built?\\\" Despite what some may think, just because we put an app in the App Store, doesn't mean it will go viral. There's an old adage that goes, \\\"build a better mousetrap, and the world will NOT beat a path to your door!\\\" You still have to market, publicize and distribute your invention, even if it's FREE, like ours! More on \\\"The Cart,\\\" in a moment. And the Payload is the UX (the user experience). But it's not just the child (the ultimate beneficiary) who must enjoy the experience enough to continue through the progressive learning modules, it's also the parent, or guardian, or friend, or grandparent, or sibling, or concerned adult, who must be supported. And for that we are building the support system and the support network that will scale with the app, and not constrain the growth and penetration of the app into the vast layers and interconnected folds of American society. The UX is being tested and empowered to work in a controlled environment before it is released into an uncontrolled environment like the App Store or Google Play, where its success will depend upon ease of use, ease of understanding and the support that we provide to caring adults who download the app for the purpose of saving their child from living a life of impoverishment, without education, without access to information, and without hope. In addition, all of our external communications will be supported and cross connected through our website. Our brand, image, content and messaging will be a collaboration of our graphic design, UX, Communications and Web Mastery teams. The specific software we use to update and improve our website will be determined soon, after we have assessed all of the new component parts we wish to include in our web presence. As for the curriculum, we have approximately 1,500 of 2,000 screens completed. After the child learns the fundamentals of letters and sounds and how to blend sound symbols to form words and sentences (using a super-child-friendly, phonetic code called 21E), we transition them to English, where we utilize our patented diacritic decoding system to introduce them to the irregular letter patterns found in English spelling. From there, we continue to increase students' awareness of the various letter patterns and combinations, while simultaneously introducing them to more and more complex sentences, stories and interactive, fiction and non-fiction content. Our Curriculum Content Development team will be helping to build the final 10 modules plus additional content (300-500 screens) of the app and will be sourcing additional books, stories, games, puzzles and other content that children will transition to (an interactive \\\"Content Library\\\") after they have finished the 12-hour structured curriculum. There's much more to tell. You can read more about our story and about us on our website at www.YouthLit.org , however, keep in mind that many updates to that website are coming soon! Meanwhile, our Engineering team, they will be working to prepare the app for launch this Thanksgiving, 2020 by coordinating with our NY-based engineering partner to ensure usability and compatibility with a variety of iOS devices. As for our Community Outreach / Distribution Team, our challenge is to bring the app to children who are not learning how to read in school, either because they are in schools that are failing or because they are in difficult situations at home for a variety of reasons. Many parents are desperate for an education solution for their children, but the challenge of teaching reading to children is too great for teachers on their own with upwards of 40+ children in a class in many cases, combined with a reading curriculum that is confusing and doesn&rsquo;t scale. Children get lost, confused and bored, and many of them act out, forcing teachers to focus on classroom management as opposed to classroom learning. The real literacy rates in so many thousands of America&rsquo;s elementary schools are 20% or less in 3rd grade and beyond! But this doesn&rsquo;t have to be this way and FUNetix is going to change ALL of this, soon! Our Community Outreach Team Leads will be building relationships with community leaders of all types and varieties to first, assess needs, and then deliver solutions to millions of parents who have no other place to turn. Our goal is not simply to tell parents what WE have, but rather, to listen to their needs vicariously, through our community advocates, in order to best tailor our app-based solution to meet THEIR needs. We are partnering with thought leaders, community leaders, religious leaders, other non-profits and NGO&rsquo;s, national leaders, role models, such as entertainment and sports figures, corporate leaders and philanthropists, and any and all people and organizations who are focused on fundamentally and permanently improving the education landscape for ALL of America&rsquo;s children. Our Community Outreach and Distribution Team Leads are individuals with diverse backgrounds and with diverse interests and talents, but most of all, they are individuals who have a willingness to reach out to communities in need and to the leaders within those communities, as well as to other leaders who can help make a difference. If you wish to be considered for this opportunity to be one of the three leads for our Community Outreach/Distribution Team, please send us a cover letter and resume to HR@YouthLit.org. We are looking for intelligent, creative, outgoing, enthusiastic, cheerful, optimistic individuals with significant real world experience and a willingness to both talk and listen to people and to identify ways to best share the benefits of our app with children in need. This is a complex undertaking and we are looking for highly proficient and organized professionals. Just to be clear, our organization is an all volunteer, mission-centric, extended virtual network, comprised of highly skilled and experienced individuals from around the country (and a few from around the world) who collaborate through cloud-based technology and platforms. Individuals interested in this position must have the confidence and ability to work in a virtual environment using select networking and communications tools and platforms. Given the current \\\"social distancing\\\" environment that we find ourselves in, individuals must also be willing to pick up the phone, send out emails, schedule Zoom meetings and use other communications technologies to contact and build relationships with our target audience. Thank you! We hope this opportunity finds you at the right place and the right time in your career to make a difference and an impact, in an amazing way, for millions of children who are waiting for someone, or some thing, to lead them out of a life of impoverishment and into a future of unlimited possibility and potential. We look forward to hearing from you and speaking with you about the future of literacy in America. Mr. R.

Is your child an emerging reader in 1st, 2nd or 3rd grade who is on the path to reading, but isn&rsquo;t quite there yet? Now you can do something incredible to help your child, to help your family, and to help potentially millions of children and millions of families across the country, by teaching your child how to read in 12 hours using the FUNetix Literacy App, and by providing us with critical \\\"user feedback\\\" as part of our Advanced Product Trials. Imagine that your child could be reading within 12 hours of starting the FUNetix app. They can finish the school year on a strong, positive note, and they can continue reading throughout the summer, getting ready for their next grade level! The American Youth Literacy Foundation is a nationwide 501 (c) (3), charitable non-profit, founded in 2008 and dedicated to bringing literacy to ALL children by the time they finish 3rd grade. For the past 12 years, we have worked with thousands of children of all abilities across the country, teaching them how to read. We&rsquo;ve been able to identify and resolve the root cause of the reading problem. And we&rsquo;ve unlocked the \\\"secret code\\\" that enables kids to learn how to read incredibly quickly, and with a deep understanding of fundamental reading principles. After tens of thousands of hours working with children from all socio-economic backgrounds (and all reading abilities) across the country, we have developed and patented a reading curriculum called FUNetix. For 12 years we have been using this patented curriculum to teach children how to read. And for the past 4 years we have been translating our instructional games and activities into an app. We began building our app long before the Coronavirus ever hit, and we will be teaching children long after the Coronavirus leaves; but for right now, we are doing our final preparations to bring the app to the App Store and Google Play by Thanksgiving, 2020. By participating in our advanced product trials, you will be able to access the app before anyone else. We are inviting up to 1,000 people to download and play the entire app and provide critical feedback to us so that we can make our final decisions on how to optimize the user experience (UX) ahead of our launch. By using the FUNetix app, your child will learn ALL 44 sounds of the English language . They will learn how to blend sounds and sound symbols together to form words, using a \\\"Secret Code\\\" called 21E(r). They will learn all of this in about 4 hours. Then they will begin reading English words using our patented system of diacritics, which are special, child friendly sound symbols that show your child how to pronounce ANY English word. It takes about another 4 hours to begin mastering this special pronunciation guide. Then your child will spend another 4 hours of the app practicing, by playing games and reading stories, and receiving additional instruction, in order to build their skills and their confidence. After about 12 hours of total instruction time, your child will gain access to an entire library of wonderful content, including books, games, puzzles, poems, stories and treasure hunts. As they work their way through the many varied reading options, they will always have a simple button to push when they want to see, for example, how a new word is pronounced. They simply push the FUNetix button within the game or story and the diacritics magically appear. We call this button, the \\\"Magic Decoder.\\\" But you can only use the \\\"Magic Decoder\\\" if you know the \\\"Secret Code.\\\" Children who know the Secret Code can push the Magic Decoder button whenever they want to unlock the pronunciation of ANY English word. That&rsquo;s FUNetix! Your child will come out of the app reading at about a 2nd grade level, and they will be ready to accelerate at lightning speed into all things written, including books, stories, and grade level course material. If your child is already in 3rd grade or higher, they will now have the fundamental reading skills they need to quickly catch up to their grade level course material. The app works because it teaches \\\"phonological (sound) awareness\\\" FIRST, allowing the developing brain to create a \\\"neural map\\\" of the 44 unique sounds of English via the use of child-friendly, pictograms, or, \\\"sound symbols.\\\" The app works because it first shows children that each sound can be represented as a symbol; and then it shows children that these sound symbols can be blended together to form the very same words that we use in our everyday conversations. Children begin to recognize that sound symbols are the pictorial representations of our spoken language, and the fundamental building blocks of written code. The app works because it introduces English much later in the reading process (4 hours later). English spelling patterns like \\\"ee\\\" and \\\"ea,\\\" etc. are equated to one of the 44 building blocks of sound that the student is now already familiar with. When the app introduces English, it does so by showing children ALL of the pieces of a given word and how the sound of each piece (\\\"phonics\\\") is easily revealed by the Magic Decoder (the diacritic symbols they already know, strategically positioned above the word.) The app works because it teaches ALL of the fundamentals of reading in the RIGHT order. And the app works because it provides children with a \\\"touch of the button\\\" pronunciation guide, and teaches them how to interpret that pronunciation guide. It&rsquo;s like a set of training wheels. Children learn using the diacritics, but once they have seen a word a few times, they no longer need them. By the end of the app, children are essentially weaned off of the diacritics except where new, \\\"novel\\\" words are introduced, words that they have never seen before. For new words, students always have the FUNetix button available so they never have to ask a parent or teacher or older sibling how to decode it. They can do it themselves! And if it&rsquo;s a word they already know the meaning of, they immediately make the association and UNDERSTAND the context in which it is being used. So if you have 12 hours that you would like to donate to this cause, we are looking for up to 1,000 early users. We hope that you and your child have an incredible experience learning how to read with the patented \\\"FUNetix 12 Hour Literacy App!\\\" And we hope that your child becomes a lifelong reader like so many other children who have learned how to read using the FUNetix curriculum. And we hope that your candid feedback will help us make this app as fun and interesting and enjoyable as possible for millions of children who will use it after Thanksgiving, 2020. And of course this is all FREE. We are a 501 (c) (3) charitable non-profit, and we are giving this app away to the world, for FREE! That&rsquo;s our purpose and our mission! To sign up, simply go to www.FUNetix.org . Thank you for considering this opportunity and we wish you the very best, especially in these challenging times! -From ALL of us on the FUNetix Literacy App team, thank you! Mr. R.

Feel free to also check us out on our website to learn more about us at www.TEACH4Kids.org Who We Are: TEACH (Together Educating All Children in Hospitals) is an international not-for-profit organization that brings exciting, hands-on, STEM educational programming to children in hospitals. Our mission is to create an outlet for children of all ages to passionately engage with the sciences through the medium of fun, interactive experiments. Through engagement with practical science concepts, the children are challenged yet empowered. They emerge comforted and confident, encouraged to successfully cope with the trials that lie before them. TEACH modules challenge children to think creatively and bring an element of fun to an otherwise monotonous day. When TEACH volunteers visit, children get excited and get to experience STEM topics through more than 75 different interactive modules. Patients can learn about real life concepts while also having an exceptional amount of fun. They are amazed as they create silly putty while they learn about polymers and use basic engineering principles to build boats that really float. Observing the science of physiological respiration using yeast to inflate a balloon or discovering density by creating their very own lava lamps truly changes the way they view science, their stay in the hospital and life. What makes us special is that TEACH was founded by and is entirely run by students. In Spring 2013, TEACH&rsquo;s two co-founders were inspired to help with the need for interaction and activity, the craving for a personal bond, and the lack of mental and physical stimulation exhibited by hospitalized children. Under the mentorship and guidance of Dr. Edward Burns of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, TEACH was created to heal through teaching. TEACH began with monthly modules in a local Bronx hospital. In just over a year, TEACH grew to reach nine hospitals with hundreds of students signed up to volunteer from various universities around the tristate area. We have served over 3000 children, 30 hospitals internationally, and 1000 volunteers. What TEACH Needs TEACH is seeking an enthusiastic and passionate individual that wants to make a difference in the lives of medically ill children. We need someone who is committed to the organization both in the time they commit to as well as a financial responsibility to support the organization. Our Advisory board members are required to be active within the organization and play a significant role in the growth of the organization. Advisory Board Member Responsibilities TEACH Advisory board will meet periodically and communicates via email and phone at various times throughout the year. Advisory Board members are required to assist fundraising efforts and participate in at least one committee. Some of the things that they would need to participate in would be to promote events, participate in peer to peer campaigns, help with corporate partnerships and networking.

Volunteer Opportunities: Companionship Volunteers work directly with patients providing companionship, offering friendly visits, reading to patients, writing letters, offering a gentle touch or sharing a quiet moment. Complementary Volunteers are certified/trained professionals who can provide complementary modalities of reflexology, music, imagery and touch therapies such as Reiki, massage, therapeutic touch and healing hands. Pet Therapy Volunteers provide certified/trained pets who visit with patients. These animals provide loving memories for some and give unconditional love helping our patients feel connected to a larger world. Administrative Volunteers provide help to the staff in our Edison office by assisting with typing, addressing cards, organizing newsletters, creating packets, collating manuals and other varied clerical duties Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, huggable dolls/bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Junior Volunteers consist of groups such as girl/boy scouts or young people who wish to honor our patients by making holiday cards, posters, wall hangings and memory books. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families and friends of patients who have passed.

The Activist Training Lab is the Endangered Species Coalition&rsquo;s competitive, year-long training program for people who want to learn how to make an impact through grassroots organizing and political advocacy! The Endangered Species Coalition&rsquo;s mission is to stop the human-caused extinction of our nation&rsquo;s most at-risk species. Our world is currently experiencing devastating biodiversity loss, caused by human activities such as habitat destruction, climate change, chemical pollution, and the wildlife trade. This loss of biodiversity threatens all of us, but disproportionately hurts the most marginalized people in society, including people of color, Indigenous peoples, low-income communities, and others. The Activist Training Lab will develop your organizing and advocacy skills broadly and will also deepen your knowledge of the critical, interconnected issues of biodiversity conservation and environmental justice. The transformative year-long program is designed to provide you with a powerful combination of environmental knowledge, grassroots organizing skills, and opportunities for hands-on experience with activism. You will complete the program with the tools to create real impact in your community on the issues you are most passionate about, from wildlife conservation to justice work. If you want to become an agent of change, this is the program for you. Visit https://www.endangered.org/activist-training-lab/ to find the application and apply before July 1st, 2020! How It Works You&rsquo;ll be part of a small group of 12 - 16 people from across the United States, of different ages and backgrounds, who all care about protecting our planet and our people through grassroots organizing. Together, you and your cohort will complete the year-long Activist Training Lab program, which includes: Webinars, where you learn about different topics and skills from experts across the environmental community and participate in engaging discussions. Opportunities to get hands-on experience with activism and make an impact in your community, with the support of the Activist Training Lab team. Access to books, articles, movies, videos, and other resources for further learning. One-on-one support and mentorship from someone on the Activist Training Lab team. Benefits of Participating Build skills such as recruiting people, developing leaders, running meetings, telling compelling stories, working with the media, lobbying, planning events, and more. Learn more about conservation, environmental policy, and environmental justice. Develop lasting friendships with a network of professional and volunteer environmentalists and organizers across the country. Earn a certificate of completion that can build your resume, support a career change, and or be used toward high school or college community service requirements (depending on your county). Become someone who is better equipped to make a difference in your community and the world at large through the powerful tools of organizing and advocacy Logistics The Activist Training Lab program will begin in September 2020 and conclude in August 2021. We expect participants to commit to the entire year. The program requires ~10 hours per month. Webinars (2 hours) will occur twice a month (every other week). Between the webinars there will be opportunities to get hands-on practice with the skills you have learned and receive one-on-one support and mentorship. The program is completed entirely online and through work in your own community. And the Activist Training Lab is 100% free - no fees. Who Can Apply You must be 16 years of age or older. You must live in the United States. This is not for professional environmental advocates or organizers (meaning you currently work or have significant professional experience in this field). This program is designed for people who are volunteer activists or want to become volunteer activists, or who are hoping to start a career in environmental organizing but have not yet. We believe that biodiversity loss disproportionately impacts the most marginalized people in our society, and we believe vulnerable communities must be centered in the work we do. We especially encourage you to apply if you identify with a community that has traditionally been marginalized in the environmental movement and society at large, including (but not limited to) people of color, Indigenous peoples, youth, seniors, and LGBTQ+ , low-income, rural, and immigrant communities. How Do I Apply? You can apply by visiting https://www.endangered.org/activist-training-lab/ and sending in an application by July 1st, 2020. You will receive information about the status of your application by July 17th, 2020. We will carefully select the strongest applicants to move on to interviews conducted over phone and video chat. The strongest applicants will: Demonstrate a clear interest in protecting biodiversity and advancing environmental justice Demonstrate a clear interest in building skills of grassroots organizing and mobilization Be enthusiastic about committing to a year-long program Be excited to learn through both webinars and hands-on work in your community Be committed to learning in a diverse community and respecting people of different identities and backgrounds Who&rsquo;s Running The Program?

Sprout is a non-profit organization based in New York City focused on providing innovative programs for adults with developmental disabilities.With our network of resources and dedicated volunteers, which we call leaders, Sprout opens up fascinating new worlds to people with disabilities. Sprout's Overnight Vacations Program is looking for individuals who have the energy, motivation and desire to work with adults with developmental disabilities. What do Sprout leaders do? Sprout leaders' primary goal is to give adults with developmental disabilities the opportunity to experience and enjoy recreational, educational and leisure activities through overnight vacations. Leaders are responsible for the overall safety and enjoyment of their group, 24 hours a day, while on a Sprout trip. Duties include safety monitoring, personal hygiene assistance, providing physical and emotional support, activity planning, budgeting, logistics, and enhancing fun. The work is hard yet immensely rewarding as you develop leadership skills and gain insight into your own abilities. What type of training is provided? Leaders must complete a pre-service training, which provides the necessary procedures and tools to run a successful and enjoyable vacation. Leaders who are drivers receive extra training on how to safely drive our 15-passenger vans. In addition, all leaders receive a copy of Sprout's Leadership Handbook to help with policies and guidelines. What is the time commitment? Sprout vacations last 3 - 7 days depending on the time of year and destination of the trip. When a leader is selected for an overnight vacation, Sprout asks that the leader dedicate themselves to stay with their group throughout the entire duration of the vacation. Some leaders only choose to lead one trip a year while others spend several months with us leading up to 8 trips or more. Sprout strives to make our program flexible for our leaders based on the amount of time leaders can give. Do leaders have any free or personal time while on a trip? Sprout trips are working vacations for the leaders who choose to participate. Because Sprout leaders are responsible for their group 24 hours a day, there is no free or personal time allotted. In order to give our participants the opportunity to experience and enjoy a vacation, Sprout leaders must be available at all times to provide the support any one participant may need. What type of trips can Sprout leaders expect to join? A majority of Sprout trips take place within a day's drive of New York City. Destinations include Atlantic City, Amish Country, Boston, Lake George, Cleveland, Maine and Virginia Beach. Exotic trips like cruises, Hawaii, and Europe are presented to leaders who have demonstrated high levels of commitment, service hours and have gained positive feedback from participants and Sprout office staff. Are there any special skills or requirements? No special background or education is required to become a Sprout leader. We encourage people from all cultures and professions, and of all ethnic and educational backgrounds. Once accepted into the program, you will receive the necessary tools to sign up for outings and how to assist our participants.

These volunteers will receive intensive training to equip them with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate their way through the court and child welfare systems. They will learn how to advocate for the best interest of children and make sure that the children receive the services and assistance necessary to ensure that they move as quickly as possible toward safe and permanent homes. Please note: No legal or social service experience is required, but you must be 21 years of age. The CASA training is approximately thirty hours, and the volunteer is required to make an eighteen month commitment.

Aging out of foster care without a life plan, without a permanent place to live, without a job places these young people at great risk. These risks include homelessness, unemployment, substance abuse, criminal involvement and Mental health issues. CASA of Union County is actively recruiting volunteers as part of our Fostering Futures project to become advocate/mentors for older foster youth. These volunteers will work with the young people and help them transition out of the system and ensure that they have the life skills and plans they need to have a safe, stable and successful future. As trained advocate/mentors, CASA volunteers are appointed by judges to be a voice for these children in court. As their advocate, you will be the voice for the young person in court, making sure that the judge knows what is in the young person's best interests. As their mentor you will work with the young person to help them make the best decisions and plans for their futures. The result is that the young person is more likely to achieve positive outcomes after they leave foster care. CASA of Union County is currently recruiting for our Spring 2017 class of volunteers. These volunteers will receive intensive training to equip them with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate their way through the court and child welfare systems. They will learn how to advocate for the best interest of the young people they are working with and make sure that they receive the services and assistance necessary to lead successful adult lives. A CASA volunteer is paired with one child or sibling set and stays on the case until the young person leaves the system. Please note: No legal or social service experience is required, but you must be 21 years of age. The CASA training is approximately thirty hours, with an additional 8 hour training to work specifically with young people between the ages of 14 and 21. The volunteer is required to make an 18 month commitment. By law, volunteers must have a full criminal background check and fingerprint check, as well as a screening interview before beginning training. We are especially in need of bilingual - particularly Spanish-speaking - volunteers.

In becoming a CASA volunteer you will become the voice for a child in a court proceeding, which often overlooks the wants, needs and desires of the child.

They are more likely than other children to face homelessness, unemployment, even prison as adults. That's why Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) for children are important. CASA was created to make sure the abuse and neglect these children originally suffered at home doesn't continue as abuse and neglect at the hands of the system. As trained advocates, CASA volunteers are appointed by judges to be a voice for these children in court. The result is that a child is placed into a safe, loving home where he/she can thrive.

Four-month-old Bosley is a puppy with a special mission. One day, he will provide enhanced independence and mobility to a person with disabilities - whether they're blind or visually impaired, or have a disability other than blindness. But Bosley isn't growing up at the Guide Dog Foundation for the Blind. Each year, the Guide Dog Foundation breeds about 300 exceptional puppies, and it's vital that Bosley and other pups like him spend the first year of their lives with surrounded by the love and security of volunteer foster families called puppy walkers. Puppy walkers help Foundation puppies grow up to be confident dogs. What's involved in raising a Guide Dog Foundation puppy? Bosley went to live with his puppy walkers when he was about nine weeks old. He's learning basic obedience and social skills while being exposed to many different situations. People who raise Guide Dog Foundation puppies say it is the most rewarding thing they've ever done. Puppy raisers come from everywhere - stay-at-home moms or dads, teachers, college students, retirees, people with flexible work environments - and are crucial members of the Guide Dog Foundation family. By opening their hearts and homes to a puppy, a puppy raiser plays a crucial role in helping a person with disabilities live an independent life. Every puppy walker family works with a Guide Dog Foundation puppy adviser, who is available to answer questions and offer guidance and support. When he is about 14 months old, Bosley will return to the Guide Dog Foundation's Smithtown campus to begin his training as a guide or service dog. Puppy raisers will admit it's tough to say good-bye, but when they see the pup they raised take its place at the side of someone with disabilities, the ache they feel turns pride. There are puppies waiting now to join your loving home for a chance to start their careers.

Reading Partners needs volunteers like you to provide individualized reading support to students in under-resourced elementary schools. Reading is the foundation for all future learning. The ability to read transforms lives and empowers children to reach their full potential. Research shows that when students can read at grade level by fourth grade, they have a greater opportunity to succeed in school and beyond. With your help, we can equip students with the foundational skills they need to read at grade level. Each week, you will meet with your student for a one-on-one tutoring session to help them develop strong literacy skills and discover a passion for reading. We'll provide a structured curriculum, in-person training, and ongoing support to help your student thrive. Rigorous research has proven that Reading Partners significantly increases reading proficiency. No teaching experience required and anyone over the age of 14 can volunteer.

Grace Healthcare Services is a Hospice organization that cares for patients throughout NJ. Veterans at the end of life. Volunteers are an essential component of this care. WHY A NEED FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS? -Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect to patients who have served our country. -Veterans share a common bond and code of conduct. -The camaraderie that exists between Veterans has proven to be a great support for the Veterans we care for. As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee. Please help us honor our Veterans by giving them the gift of your time.

Grace Healthcare Services is a Hospice organization that cares for patients throughout NJ. Veterans at the end of life. Volunteers are an essential component of this care. WHY A NEED FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS? -Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect to patients who have served our country. -Veterans share a common bond and code of conduct. -The camaraderie that exists between Veterans has proven to be a great support for the Veterans we care for. As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee. Please help us honor our Veterans by giving them the gift of your time.

Grace Healthcare Services is a Hospice organization that cares for patients throughout NJ. Veterans at the end of life. Volunteers are an essential component of this care. WHY A NEED FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS? -Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect to patients who have served our country. -Veterans share a common bond and code of conduct. -The camaraderie that exists between Veterans has proven to be a great support for the Veterans we care for. As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee. Please help us honor our Veterans by giving them the gift of your time.

Here is an opportunity to help underprivileged children, to help under-served children, to help ALL children displaced from school due to COVID-19, and even to help many adults who can't read. We are looking for three, very special people, who have the skills, expertise, experience, passion, and time to be part of something amazing that is about to fundamentally change the lives of millions of children. Right now, millions of children have no hope; but soon, they will have the opportunity to learn how to read, which, in turn, will open a window to education and to a world of potential for them that, not only, has never been opened before, but that has never even been seriously contemplated as a potential reality. What we are talking about is adaptive learning, gamified smartphone app, called FUNetix, that can literally, teach a child how to read, in the comfort of their home, in an average of just 12 hours of total use time! We are the American Youth Literacy Foundation, and we have been teaching children how to read for nearly 12 years! We have been developing this app for about two years, and this year we will launch this incredible smartphone app in the App Store and on Google Play by Thanksgiving, 2020, to help save millions of children from a lifetime of illiteracy! Already, there are millions of children who are struggling to learn how to read. Already, there are millions more who have given up on reading and are destined to go through life either completely illiterate, or with semi-literate skills at best. And now with the displacement of tens of millions of children from school, for an indeterminate amount of time , the loss of reading capacity of the next generation presents a new, crisis moment in American education \u00c2 and a very real threat to the future success of millions of young students. We are partnered with an engineering team that was one of the five $1 million finalists in the XPrize for Global Learning competition (the winners of which were announced this past May), which was a worldwide competition for app \\\"design and development\\\" teams from around the world to design, build and deliver a tablet-based app to children in remote villages in Africa which could teach them how to read and do basic math (children of all ages, most of whom had never been to school before in their lives). The curriculum that our app is based on is a patented reading decoding system, and is so effective at teaching children how to read, that it usually only takes 4-6 hours for them to understand the basic learning tools, and another 4-6 hours for them to reach a 2nd grade reading level. Compare this to so many of our students who have been in the public school system for 6 years and still can't spell the word \\\"the.\\\" Compare this to millions of students who have dropped out of school, primarily because they can't read (more than 10 million per decade). More than 20 million children in grades 3-12 in America's public schools today can't read! Our organization is a 12 year old, nationwide, charitable 501 c 3 non-profit. We started out as a tutoring program and we still provide one-on-one tutoring. But our focus has always been on finding a scalable solution to the literacy crisis in America. With the rise of the smartphone and the amazing penetration of this powerful tool (currently estimated at 80%), even into the most impoverished communities, we feel that the answer we have been searching for IS in the form of an app. So for the past several years we have been working to convert our amazing reading curriculum, that teaches children how to read in an average of just 12 hours, into an app that teaches children how to read in about the same time. And this is where you come in. We have a LOT of opportunity in front of us to finish building and testing, and, ultimately, to deliver an end-user experience (the UX) to millions of children in America's inner cities and rural counties, in the barrios and the suburbs, and on the American Indian reservations, and everywhere in-between, with this smartphone app. But in order to do this, we need to complete three pieces of the equation: The Horse, The Cart, and the Payload. The Horse is the curriculum; and it is well under way in the conversion process from an analog to a digital curriculum. The Cart is the distribution system, the \\\"how do we get it out into communities and to the children, once it's built?\\\" Despite what some may think, just because we put an app in the App Store, doesn't mean it will go viral. There's an old adage that goes, \\\"build a better mousetrap, and the world will NOT beat a path to your door!\\\" You still have to market, publicize and distribute your invention, even if it's FREE, like ours! And the Payload is the UX (the user experience). But it's not just the child (the ultimate beneficiary) who must enjoy the experience enough to continue through the progressive learning modules, it's also the parent, or guardian, or friend, or grandparent, or sibling, or concerned adult, who must be supported. And for that we are building the support system and the support network that will scale with the app, and not constrain the growth and penetration of the app into the interstitial spaces of American society. The UX must be tested and must be proven to work in a controlled environment before it is released into an uncontrolled environment like the App Store or Google Play, where its success will depend upon ease of use, ease of understanding and the support that we provide to caring adults who download the app for the purpose of saving their child from living a life of impoverishment, without education, and without hope. That support network for caring adults will consist of in-app information as well as web-based content that they can refer to to gain a better understanding of what the app is and how it works and how they can best assist their child through the learning process. In addition, all of our external communications will be supported and cross connected through our website. Our brand, image, content and messaging will be a collaboration of our graphic design, UX, communications and Web Development teams. The specific software we use to update and improve our website will be decided after we have assessed all of the new component parts we wish to include in our web presence. As for the curriculum, we have approximately 1,500 of 2,000 screens completed. After the child learns the fundamentals of letters and sounds and how to blend sound symbols to form words and sentences (using a super-child-friendly, phonetic code called 21E), we transition them to English, where we utilize our patented diacritic decoding system to introduce them to the irregular letter patterns found in English spelling. From there, we continue to increase students' awareness of the various letter patterns and combinations, while simultaneously introducing them to more and more complex sentences, stories and interactive, fiction and non-fiction content. Our Curriculum Content Development team will be helping to build the final five modules plus additional content (300-500 screens) of the app and will be sourcing additional books, stories, games, puzzles and other content that children will transition to (a content library) after they have finished the 12-hour structured curriculum. There's much more to tell. You can read more about our story and about us on our current website (built in Wordpress) at www.YouthLit.org. We have much to do to add to and rework the web experience to best reflect our current app-focused mission. As for our Web Development team, we are looking for 3 very special people who have everything we mentioned above, passion, expertise, time, etc. to join our team and help us launch this app this Thanksgiving, 2020. Our three Web Development Team Leads will help develop, plan and execute a complete website overhaul. The messaging, branding, look and feel, content, graphics, and animation, will come from a deep collaboration with the other team members mentioned above and will require experience, strategic and creative thinking, excellent planning and communications skills and strong graphics and coding skills. If you wish to be considered for this opportunity to be one of the three leads for our Web Mastery Team, please send us a cover letter and resume to HR@YouthLit.org. We are looking for intelligent, creative, enthusiastic, cheerful, optimistic individuals with significant website development and maintenance experience, in either a corporate or non-profit environment. This is a complex undertaking and we are looking for highly proficient and organized professionals. Just to be clear, our organization is an all volunteer, mission-centric, extended virtual network, comprised of highly skilled and experienced individuals from around the country (and a few from around the world) who collaborate through cloud-based technology and platforms. Individuals interested in this position must have the confidence and ability to work in a virtual environment using select networking and communications tools and platforms. Thank you! We hope this opportunity finds you at the right place and the right time in your career to make a difference and an impact, in an amazing way, for millions of children who are waiting for someone, or some thing, to lead them out of a life of impoverishment and into a future of unlimited possibility and potential.

Here is an opportunity to help underprivileged children, to help under-served children, to help the more than 55 million children displaced from school due to COVID-19, and even to help many adults who can't read. Here is an opportunity to help close the social inequality gap, by closing the opportunity gap, by closing the education gap, by closing the literacy gap, and by creating a new era of near-100% literacy for the next generation of emerging American school children. We are looking for six, very special people, who have the skills, expertise, experience, passion, and time to be part of something amazing that is about to fundamentally change the lives of millions of children. Right now, millions of children have no hope; but soon, they will have the opportunity to learn how to read, which, in turn, will open a window to education and to a world of potential for them that, not only, has never been opened before, but that has never even been seriously contemplated as a potential reality. What we are talking about is adaptive learning, gamified smartphone app, called FUNetix, that can literally, teach a child how to read, in their own home, in an average of just 12 hours of total use time! We are the American Youth Literacy Foundation, and we have been teaching children how to read for nearly 12 years! We have been developing this app for about two years, and this year we will launch this incredible smartphone app in the App Store and on Google Play by Thanksgiving, 2020, to help save millions of children from a lifetime of illiteracy! Already, there are millions of children who are struggling to learn how to read. Already, there are millions more who have given up on reading and are destined to go through life either completely illiterate, or with semi-literate skills at best. And now with the displacement of tens of millions of children from school, for an indeterminate amount of time , the loss of reading capacity of the next generation presents a new, watershed moment in American education; this can either be a crisis, and a very real threat to the future success of millions of young students, or it can become an opportunity to change the American education landscape forever , by bringing literacy to millions of children who would otherwise have continued down the same path of scarcity and deprivation as so many generations before them. So many people are asking for \\\"Real Solutions\\\" now, not just talk, or continued, seemingly never-ending \\\"conversations\\\" about social reform. At the American Youth Literacy Foundation, we believe that literacy itself, second only to family and faith, is the single most \\\"upstream\\\" component parts of that \\\"Real Solution;\\\" and that literacy is the underpinning of all education; and that education is the key to every individual's opportunity for self-actualization, and the only truly scaleable, truly proven \\\"ticket\\\" out of the oppressive burden of poverty. We are partnered with an engineering team that was one of the five, $1 million finalists, in the XPrize for Global Learning competition (the winners of which were announced last May), which was a worldwide competition for app \\\"design and development\\\" teams to design, build and deliver a tablet-based app to children in remote villages in Africa which could teach them how to read and do basic math (children of all ages, most of whom had never been to school before in their lives). The Xprize competition was incredibly successful at bringing awareness and attention to the use of technology as a potential equalizer in the world of education. The curriculum that our app is based on is a patented reading decoding system , and is so effective at teaching children how to read, that it usually only takes 4-6 hours for them to understand the basic learning tools, and another 4-6 hours for them to reach a 2nd grade reading level. Compare this to so many of our students who have been in the public school system for 6 years and still can't spell simple words like \\\"the, said, was, would, could, there or through.\\\" Compare this to millions of students who have dropped out of school, primarily because they can't read ( more than 10 million per decade (24% according to U.S. Government statistics)). More than 20 million children in grades 3-12 in America's public schools today are either completely or functionally illiterate, according to the U.S. Government&rsquo;s \\\"Annual Report Card.\\\" Our organization is a 12-year-old, nationwide, charitable 501 c 3 non-profits founded in 2008. We started out as a regional tutoring program, then became a nationwide tutoring program; but all the while, our focus has always been on finding a scalable solution to the literacy crisis in America. With the rise of the smartphone and the amazing penetration of this powerful tool (more than 80% in even the most impoverished communities), we feel that the answer we have been searching for IS in the form of an app. So for the past several years, we have been working to convert our amazing reading curriculum that teaches children how to read in 12 hours, into an app that teaches children how to read in 12 hours. And this is where you come in. We have more than 50 people working to build, test, and deliver this app to millions of children in America's inner cities and rural communities, to the barrios and the suburbs and the American Indian reservations and everywhere in-between. But in order to do this, we need to reach the people who need it the most. And in order to reach those people and those communities, we need to hear from you, and people like you who live in those communities. We need to better understand the current state of the schools and the education system at the local level in your neighborhood, town or city. We need to more fully understand the specific challenges that illiteracy and low literacy have burdened your community with, so that we can more fully develop a workable tactical plan to reverse the literacy crisis and lift those burdens, using the FUNetix Reading App. The FUNetix curriculum is approximately 12 hours and 2,000 screens that take a child from the ABC's to a 2nd-grade reading level. Children learn the fundamentals of letters and sounds and how to blend sound symbols together to form words and sentences. The app uses a super-child-friendly, phonetic code called 21E, that makes it easy to learn how to read. The FUNetix Reading System is patented and uses a special diacritic decoding system to show children the irregular spelling patterns of English, and especially how to pronounce any English word. At the American Youth Literacy Foundation, our goal is to bring the FUNetix Reading App to children who are not learning how to read in school, either because they are in schools that are failing, or because they are in difficult situations at home for a variety of reasons. Many parents are desperate for an education solution for their children, but the challenge of teaching reading to children is too great for teachers with classes of up to 40 children or more, combined with a typical \\\"off the shelf\\\" reading curriculum that is confusing and doesn&rsquo;t scale. Children get lost, confused, frustrated and bored; and many of them act out, forcing teachers to focus on classroom management as opposed to classroom learning. The REAL literacy rates in so many thousands of America&rsquo;s elementary schools are 20% or less in 3rd grade and beyond! But it doesn't have to be that way; and FUNetix is going to change ALL of this, soon! The role of a Community Liaison is as a connector. You will help Youth Lit connect to your community and many hundreds of other communities across the United States by reaching out to understand exactly how the literacy crisis is affecting people in those communities, and by finding out what specific solutions they desire, and how best we can bring our literacy app into the homes and minds of the children who need it most. A Community Liaison is someone who is passionate about ending the literacy crisis in America, and finally creating that \\\"Equal Playing Field\\\" that everyone has been talking about for so long. But a Community Liaison also brings key ideas and action steps that they believe can be taken in order to make that happen. Such steps may involve working with specific people in the community, advertising at select locations, connecting with specific organizations, or otherwise finding ways to reach the parents and children that are most in need of a new solution to reading and education. Working together, we will radically, positively impact communities all across the United States, by bringing \\\"Literacy for All\\\" to the next generation of emerging learners. We are looking for six intelligent, creative, outgoing, enthusiastic, cheerful, optimistic individuals with significant real-world experience and a willingness to both talk to and listen to people, and to identify ways to best share the benefits of our app with those children in need. This is a complex undertaking and we are looking for highly proficient and organized professional-minded individuals who have a track record of success in creating positive outcomes in their communities, and who are willing to reach beyond, to other communities like their own, to bring change across America.

Have you ever wanted to do something AMAZING to change the world but didn't know where to start? Here is an opportunity to help underprivileged children, to help under-served children, to help ALL children displaced from school due to COVID-19, and even to help many adults who can't read. We are looking for three, very special people, who have the skills, expertise, experience, passion, and time to be part of something amazing that is about to fundamentally change the lives of millions of children. Right now, millions of children have no hope; but soon, they will have the opportunity to learn how to read, which, in turn, will open a window to education and to a world of potential for them that, not only, has never been opened before, but that has never even been seriously contemplated as a potential reality. What we are talking about is an adaptive learning, gamified smartphone app, called FUNetix, that can literally, teach a child how to read, in the comfort of their home, in an average of just 12 hours of total use time! We are the American Youth Literacy Foundation, and we have been teaching children how to read for nearly 12 years! We have been developing this app for about two years, and this year we will launch this incredible smartphone app in the App Store and on Google Play by Thanksgiving, 2020, to help save millions of children from a lifetime of illiteracy! Already, there are millions of children who are struggling to learn how to read. Already, there are millions more who have given up on reading and are destined to go through life either completely illiterate, or with semi-literate skills at best. And now with the displacement of tens of millions of children from school, for an indeterminate amount of time , the loss of reading capacity of the next generation presents a new, crisis moment in American education \u00c2 and a very real threat to the future success of millions of young students. We are partnered with an engineering team that was one of the five $1 million finalists in the XPrize for Global Learning competition (the winners of which were announced this past May), which was a worldwide competition for app \\\"design and development\\\" teams from around the world to design, build and deliver a tablet-based app to children in remote villages in Africa which could teach them how to read and do basic math (children of all ages, most of whom had never been to school before in their lives). The curriculum that our app is based on is a patented reading decoding system, and is so effective at teaching children how to read, that it usually only takes 4-6 hours for them to understand the basic learning tools, and another 4-6 hours for them to reach a 2nd grade reading level. Compare this to so many of our students who have been in the public school system for 6 years and still can't spell the word \\\"the.\\\" Compare this to millions of students who have dropped out of school, primarily because they can't read (more than 10 million per decade). More than 20 million children in grades 3-12 in America's public schools today can't read! Our organization is an 11 year old, nationwide, charitable 501 c 3 non-profit. We started out as a tutoring program and we still provide one-on-one tutoring. But our focus has always been on finding a scalable solution to the literacy crisis in America. With the rise of the smartphone and the amazing penetration of this powerful tool (currently estimated at 80%), even into the most impoverished communities, we feel that the answer we have been searching for IS in the form of an app. So for the past several years we have been working to convert our amazing reading curriculum, that teaches children how to read in an average of just 12 hours, into an app that teaches children how to read in about the same time. And this is where you come in. The App is comprised of approximately 2,000 unique screens, each of which is fully narrated. After the child learns the fundamentals of letters and sounds and how to blend sound symbols to form words and sentences (using a super-child-friendly, phonetic code called 21E), we transition them to English, where we utilize our patented diacritic decoding system to introduce them to the irregular letter patterns found in English spelling. From there, we continue to increase students' awareness of the various letter patterns and combinations, while simultaneously introducing them to more and more complex sentences, stories and interactive, fiction and non-fiction content. As students progress in their reading capability, we begin to introduce primers, books, stories, games, puzzles and other content that will be embedded within the learning modules AND that children will have access to in our \\\"Wonderful Content Library\\\" that is unlocked after they have finished the 12-hour structured curriculum. There's much more to tell. You can read more about our story and about us on our website at www.FUNetix.org and at www.YouthLit.org . We are looking for some very special people who have the passion, time, and especially, the illustration skills needed to help us populate our proprietary reading materials child-friendly, colorful, happy, creative and otherwise wonderful drawings that potentially millions of children will see on their path to learning how to read. If you wish to be considered for this opportunity to be one of volunteer children&rsquo;s book illustrators, please send us a sample of your artwork by replying to this listing. When you reply you will receive an auto-reply email containing an attached pdf. Follow the instructions on the pdf to illustrate ONLY ONE of the two story samples. (Each sample contains 2 screens, so you will be illustrating 2 screens from the same story.) Send your samples to info@FUNetix.org and we will respond to you if we choose your illustration. EVEN IF we don&rsquo;t choose you to illustrate one of the sample stories, we may still contact you to illustrate one of our many other stories or books. We are looking for intelligent, creative, enthusiastic, cheerful, optimistic individuals who can present a \\\"look and feel\\\" to children ages 5-9 that is happy, not scary; uplifting, not sad; bright and colorful, not dark or ominous; cute or whimsical, or otherwise conveying a positive outlook on the world. Thank you! We hope this opportunity finds you at the right place and the right time to make a difference and an impact, in an amazing way, for millions of children who are waiting for someone, or something, to lead them out of a life of impoverishment and into a future of unlimited possibility and potential through literacy.

We started out as a tutoring program in Philadelphia and central New Jersey, and we still provide one-on-one tutoring. But our focus has always been on finding a scalable solution to the literacy crisis in America. With the rise of the smartphone and the amazing penetration of this powerful tool (currently estimated at 80%), even into the most impoverished communities, we feel that the answer we have been searching for ABSOLUTELY comes in the form of an app. So for the past several years we have been working to convert our amazing reading curriculum, that teaches children how to read in an average of just 12 hours, into an app that teaches children how to read in about the same time. And this is where you come in. We have a LOT of opportunity in front of us to finish building and testing, and, ultimately, to deliver an end-user experience (the UX) to millions of children in America's inner cities and rural counties, in the barrios and the suburbs, and on the American Indian reservations, and everywhere in-between, with this smartphone app. But in order to do this, we need to complete three pieces of the equation: The Horse, The Cart, and the Payload. The Horse is the curriculum; and it is well under way in the conversion process from an analog to a digital curriculum. (We have designed already 1,500 of the nearly 2,000 screen, fully narrated, reading learning experience.) The Cart is the distribution system, the \\\"how do we get it out into communities and to the children, once it's built?\\\" Despite what some may think, just because we put an app in the App Store, doesn't mean it will go viral. There's an old adage that goes, \\\"build a better mousetrap, and the world will NOT beat a path to your door!\\\" You still have to market, publicize and distribute your invention, even if it's FREE, like ours! More on \\\"The Cart,\\\" in a moment. And the Payload is the UX (the user experience). But it's not just the child (the ultimate beneficiary) who must enjoy the experience enough to continue through the progressive learning modules, it's also the parent, or guardian, or friend, or grandparent, or sibling, or concerned adult, who must be supported. And for that we are building the support system and the support network that will scale with the app, and not constrain the growth and penetration of the app into the vast layers and interconnected folds of American society. The UX is being tested and empowered to work in a controlled environment before it is released into an uncontrolled environment like the App Store or Google Play, where its success will depend upon ease of use, ease of understanding and the support that we provide to caring adults who download the app for the purpose of saving their child from living a life of impoverishment, without education, without access to information, and without hope. In addition, all of our external communications will be supported and cross connected through our website. Our brand, image, content and messaging will be a collaboration of our graphic design, UX, Communications and Web Mastery teams. The specific software we use to update and improve our website will be determined soon, after we have assessed all of the new component parts we wish to include in our web presence. As for the curriculum, we have approximately 1,500 of 2,000 screens completed. After the child learns the fundamentals of letters and sounds and how to blend sound symbols to form words and sentences (using a super-child-friendly, phonetic code called 21E), we transition them to English, where we utilize our patented diacritic decoding system to introduce them to the irregular letter patterns found in English spelling. From there, we continue to increase students' awareness of the various letter patterns and combinations, while simultaneously introducing them to more and more complex sentences, stories and interactive, fiction and non-fiction content. Our Curriculum Content Development team will be helping to build the final 10 modules plus additional content (300-500 screens) of the app and will be sourcing additional books, stories, games, puzzles and other content that children will transition to (an interactive \\\"Content Library\\\") after they have finished the 12-hour structured curriculum. There's much more to tell. You can read more about our story and about us on our website at www.YouthLit.org , however, keep in mind that many updates to that website are coming soon! Meanwhile, our Engineering team, they will be working to prepare the app for launch this Thanksgiving, 2020 by coordinating with our NY-based engineering partner to ensure usability and compatibility with a variety of iOS devices. As for our Community Outreach / Distribution Team, our challenge is to bring the app to children who are not learning how to read in school, either because they are in schools that are failing or because they are in difficult situations at home for a variety of reasons. Many parents are desperate for an education solution for their children, but the challenge of teaching reading to children is too great for teachers on their own with upwards of 40+ children in a class in many cases, combined with a reading curriculum that is confusing and doesn&rsquo;t scale. Children get lost, confused and bored, and many of them act out, forcing teachers to focus on classroom management as opposed to classroom learning. The real literacy rates in so many thousands of America&rsquo;s elementary schools are 20% or less in 3rd grade and beyond! But this doesn&rsquo;t have to be this way and FUNetix is going to change ALL of this, soon! Our Community Outreach Team Leads will be building relationships with community leaders of all types and varieties to first, assess needs, and then deliver solutions to millions of parents who have no other place to turn. Our goal is not simply to tell parents what WE have, but rather, to listen to their needs vicariously, through our community advocates, in order to best tailor our app-based solution to meet THEIR needs. We are partnering with thought leaders, community leaders, religious leaders, other non-profits and NGO&rsquo;s, national leaders, role models, such as entertainment and sports figures, corporate leaders and philanthropists, and any and all people and organizations who are focused on fundamentally and permanently improving the education landscape for ALL of America&rsquo;s children. Our Community Outreach and Distribution Team Leads are individuals with diverse backgrounds and with diverse interests and talents, but most of all, they are individuals who have a willingness to reach out to communities in need and to the leaders within those communities, as well as to other leaders who can help make a difference. If you wish to be considered for this opportunity to be one of the three leads for our Community Outreach/Distribution Team, please send us a cover letter and resume to HR@YouthLit.org. We are looking for intelligent, creative, outgoing, enthusiastic, cheerful, optimistic individuals with significant real world experience and a willingness to both talk and listen to people and to identify ways to best share the benefits of our app with children in need. This is a complex undertaking and we are looking for highly proficient and organized professionals. Just to be clear, our organization is an all volunteer, mission-centric, extended virtual network, comprised of highly skilled and experienced individuals from around the country (and a few from around the world) who collaborate through cloud-based technology and platforms. Individuals interested in this position must have the confidence and ability to work in a virtual environment using select networking and communications tools and platforms.

The opportunity is flexible around your schedule, whether you can commit to one cake a year or fifty. You don&rsquo;t have to be a master cake decorator to help out, even a simple cake can make the day sweet! These children and young adult's lives when we connect with them are centered around fixing their immediate traumas - be it neglect, poverty, or abandonment.

Here is an opportunity to help underprivileged children, to help under-served children, to help ALL children displaced from school due to COVID-19, and even to help many adults who can't read. We are looking for three, very special people, who have the skills, expertise, experience, passion, and time to be part of something amazing that is about to fundamentally change the lives of millions of children. Right now, millions of children have no hope; but soon, they will have the opportunity to learn how to read, which, in turn, will open a window to education and to a world of potential for them that, not only, has never been opened before, but that has never even been seriously contemplated as a potential reality. What we are talking about is adaptive learning, gamified smartphone app, called FUNetix, that can literally, teach a child how to read, in the comfort of their home, in an average of just 12 hours of total use time! We are the American Youth Literacy Foundation, and we have been teaching children how to read for nearly 12 years! We have been developing this app for about two years, and this year we will launch this incredible smartphone app in the App Store and on Google Play by Thanksgiving, 2020, to help save millions of children from a lifetime of illiteracy! Already, there are millions of children who are struggling to learn how to read. Already, there are millions more who have given up on reading and are destined to go through life either completely illiterate, or with semi-literate skills at best. And now with the displacement of tens of millions of children from school, for an indeterminate amount of time , the loss of reading capacity of the next generation presents a new, crisis moment in American education \u00c2 and a very real threat to the future success of millions of young students. We are partnered with an engineering team that was one of the five $1 million finalists in the XPrize for Global Learning competition (the winners of which were announced this past May), which was a worldwide competition for app \\\"design and development\\\" teams from around the world to design, build and deliver a tablet-based app to children in remote villages in Africa which could teach them how to read and do basic math (children of all ages, most of whom had never been to school before in their lives). The curriculum that our app is based on is a patented reading decoding system, and is so effective at teaching children how to read, that it usually only takes 4-6 hours for them to understand the basic learning tools, and another 4-6 hours for them to reach a 2nd grade reading level. Compare this to so many of our students who have been in the public school system for 6 years and still can't spell the word \\\"the.\\\" Compare this to millions of students who have dropped out of school, primarily because they can't read (more than 10 million per decade). More than 20 million children in grades 3-12 in America's public schools today can't read! Our organization is a 12 year old, nationwide, charitable 501 c 3 non-profit. We started out as a tutoring program and we still provide one-on-one tutoring. But our focus has always been on finding a scalable solution to the literacy crisis in America. With the rise of the smartphone and the amazing penetration of this powerful tool (currently estimated at 80%), even into the most impoverished communities, we feel that the answer we have been searching for IS in the form of an app. So for the past several years we have been working to convert our amazing reading curriculum, that teaches children how to read in an average of just 12 hours, into an app that teaches children how to read in about the same time. And this is where you come in. We have a LOT of opportunity in front of us to finish building and testing, and, ultimately, to deliver an end-user experience (the UX) to millions of children in America's inner cities and rural counties, in the barrios and the suburbs, and on the American Indian reservations, and everywhere in-between, with this smartphone app. But in order to do this, we need to complete three pieces of the equation: The Horse, The Cart, and the Payload. The Horse is the curriculum; and it is well under way in the conversion process from an analog to a digital curriculum. The Cart is the distribution system, the \\\"how do we get it out into communities and to the children, once it's built?\\\" Despite what some may think, just because we put an app in the App Store, doesn't mean it will go viral. There's an old adage that goes, \\\"build a better mousetrap, and the world will NOT beat a path to your door!\\\" You still have to market, publicize and distribute your invention, even if it's FREE, like ours! And the Payload is the UX (the user experience). But it's not just the child (the ultimate beneficiary) who must enjoy the experience enough to continue through the progressive learning modules, it's also the parent, or guardian, or friend, or grandparent, or sibling, or concerned adult, who must be supported. And for that we are building the support system and the support network that will scale with the app, and not constrain the growth and penetration of the app into the interstitial spaces of American society. The UX must be tested and must be proven to work in a controlled environment before it is released into an uncontrolled environment like the App Store or Google Play, where its success will depend upon ease of use, ease of understanding and the support that we provide to caring adults who download the app for the purpose of saving their child from living a life of impoverishment, without education, and without hope. That support network for caring adults will consist of in-app information as well as web-based content that they can refer to to gain a better understanding of what the app is and how it works and how they can best assist their child through the learning process. In addition, all of our external communications will be supported and cross connected through our website. Our brand, image, content and messaging will be a collaboration of our graphic design, UX, communications and Web Development teams. The specific software we use to update and improve our website will be decided after we have assessed all of the new component parts we wish to include in our web presence. As for the curriculum, we have approximately 1,500 of 2,000 screens completed. After the child learns the fundamentals of letters and sounds and how to blend sound symbols to form words and sentences (using a super-child-friendly, phonetic code called 21E), we transition them to English, where we utilize our patented diacritic decoding system to introduce them to the irregular letter patterns found in English spelling. From there, we continue to increase students' awareness of the various letter patterns and combinations, while simultaneously introducing them to more and more complex sentences, stories and interactive, fiction and non-fiction content. Our Curriculum Content Development team will be helping to build the final five modules plus additional content (300-500 screens) of the app and will be sourcing additional books, stories, games, puzzles and other content that children will transition to (a content library) after they have finished the 12-hour structured curriculum. There's much more to tell. You can read more about our story and about us on our current website (built in Wordpress) at www.YouthLit.org. We have much to do to add to and rework the web experience to best reflect our current app-focused mission. As for our Web Development team, we are looking for 3 very special people who have everything we mentioned above, passion, expertise, time, etc. to join our team and help us launch this app this Thanksgiving, 2020. Our three Web Development Team Leads will help develop, plan and execute a complete website overhaul. The messaging, branding, look and feel, content, graphics, and animation, will come from a deep collaboration with the other team members mentioned above and will require experience, strategic and creative thinking, excellent planning and communications skills and strong graphics and coding skills. If you wish to be considered for this opportunity to be one of the three leads for our Web Mastery Team, please send us a cover letter and resume to HR@YouthLit.org. We are looking for intelligent, creative, enthusiastic, cheerful, optimistic individuals with significant website development and maintenance experience, in either a corporate or non-profit environment. This is a complex undertaking and we are looking for highly proficient and organized professionals. Just to be clear, our organization is an all volunteer, mission-centric, extended virtual network, comprised of highly skilled and experienced individuals from around the country (and a few from around the world) who collaborate through cloud-based technology and platforms. Individuals interested in this position must have the confidence and ability to work in a virtual environment using select networking and communications tools and platforms. Thank you! We hope this opportunity finds you at the right place and the right time in your career to make a difference and an impact, in an amazing way, for millions of children who are waiting for someone, or some thing, to lead them out of a life of impoverishment and into a future of unlimited possibility and potential.

About the Census Complete Count Fund The United States Constitution requires a population count-or census-every 10 years. The census determines every state's proportional representation in Congress as well as its share of federal funds for health care, education, housing, economic development, social services, roads, transportation, and more. In light of the resources that are at risk and the fact that the State of New York could lose up to two congressional seats in the case of a 2020 census undercount, it is critically important that all New Yorkers, especially those from historically undercounted communities, are counted. To support a fair and complete count, CIANA is working in partnership with the City University of New York (CUNY), Mayor de Blasio&rsquo;s NYC Census 2020 office, and the New York City Council to mobilize New Yorkers to self-respond to the 2020 census. CIANA seeks to engage the historically undercounted immigrant communities of Queens and ensure that every household is counted despite language barriers, fear of government institutions and uncertainty around the Census. CIANA is seeking exceptionally qualified candidates for the role of Census Outreach Intern. Census Outreach Interns will: work remotely to educate community members about the significance of the census and the importance of census self-response; identify and dismantle barriers to census participation; ask and encourage New Yorkers to self-respond to the 2020 census; and connect them to the tools and resources they need to self-respond. Responsibilities: Working under the leadership of CIANA&rsquo;s Census Captain and Census Manager, the Census Outreach Intern will: Build strong relationships with historically undercounted New Yorkers in order to encourage census self-response; Engage New Yorkers about the census through phone and text-banking; Track census engagement activities using both qualitative and quantitative methods; Adhere to all data security and privacy protocols around census engagement; Participate in trainings and professional development opportunities Qualifications: Experience in community engagement, campaign work, or other forms of direct outreach; Excellent communication, project management, and multi-tasking skills; Excellent interpersonal and relationship management skills; Demonstrated cultural competence with respect to the immigrant communities of Queens Understanding of New York City&rsquo;s diversity and experience working with people of diverse backgrounds; Proficiency in use of technology such as laptop computers and tablets; Proficiency in written and spoken Bangla/Arabic/Spanish preferred", "title": "Census Outreach Intern", "zipcode": "11102", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D3296942%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "Center for the Integration and Advancement of New Americans, CIANA"}, {"end": null, "description": "The City Tutors (CT) is looking for tutors to provide academic support with writing for students in HANAC's adult education program.

Pet Therapy Volunteers provide certified/trained pets who visit with patients. These animals provide loving memories for some and give unconditional love helping our patients feel connected to a larger world. Administrative Volunteers provide help to the staff in our Edison office by assisting with typing, addressing cards, organizing newsletters, creating packets, collating manuals and other varied clerical duties Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, huggable dolls/bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Junior Volunteers consist of groups such as girl/boy scouts or young people who wish to honor our patients by making holiday cards, posters, wall hangings and memory books. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families and friends of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network. Hospice training classes are required for Companionship and Complementary Volunteers. They are free of charge and offered on an ongoing basis.

Is your child an emerging reader in 1st, 2nd or 3rd grade who is on the path to reading, but isn&rsquo;t quite there yet? Now you can do something incredible to help your child, to help your family, and to help potentially millions of children and millions of families across the country, by teaching your child how to read in 12 hours using the FUNetix Literacy App, and by providing us with critical \\\"user feedback\\\" as part of our Advanced Product Trials. Imagine that your child could be reading within 12 hours of starting the FUNetix app. They can finish the school year on a strong, positive note, and they can continue reading throughout the summer, getting ready for their next grade level! The American Youth Literacy Foundation is a nationwide 501 (c) (3), charitable non-profit, founded in 2008 and dedicated to bringing literacy to ALL children by the time they finish 3rd grade. For the past 12 years, we have worked with thousands of children of all abilities across the country, teaching them how to read. We&rsquo;ve been able to identify and resolve the root cause of the reading problem. And we&rsquo;ve unlocked the \\\"secret code\\\" that enables kids to learn how to read incredibly quickly, and with a deep understanding of fundamental reading principles. After tens of thousands of hours working with children from all socio-economic backgrounds (and all reading abilities) across the country, we have developed and patented a reading curriculum called FUNetix. For 12 years we have been using this patented curriculum to teach children how to read. And for the past 4 years we have been translating our instructional games and activities into an app. We began building our app long before the Coronavirus ever hit, and we will be teaching children long after the Coronavirus leaves; but for right now, we are doing our final preparations to bring the app to the App Store and Google Play by Thanksgiving, 2020. By participating in our advanced product trials, you will be able to access the app before anyone else. We are inviting up to 1,000 people to download and play the entire app and provide critical feedback to us so that we can make our final decisions on how to optimize the user experience (UX) ahead of our launch. By using the FUNetix app, your child will learn ALL 44 sounds of the English language . They will learn how to blend sounds and sound symbols together to form words, using a \\\"Secret Code\\\" called 21E(r). They will learn all of this in about 4 hours. Then they will begin reading English words using our patented system of diacritics, which are special, child friendly sound symbols that show your child how to pronounce ANY English word. It takes about another 4 hours to begin mastering this special pronunciation guide. Then your child will spend another 4 hours of the app practicing, by playing games and reading stories, and receiving additional instruction, in order to build their skills and their confidence. After about 12 hours of total instruction time, your child will gain access to an entire library of wonderful content, including books, games, puzzles, poems, stories and treasure hunts. As they work their way through the many varied reading options, they will always have a simple button to push when they want to see, for example, how a new word is pronounced. They simply push the FUNetix button within the game or story and the diacritics magically appear. We call this button, the \\\"Magic Decoder.\\\" But you can only use the \\\"Magic Decoder\\\" if you know the \\\"Secret Code.\\\" Children who know the Secret Code can push the Magic Decoder button whenever they want to unlock the pronunciation of ANY English word. That&rsquo;s FUNetix! Your child will come out of the app reading at about a 2nd grade level, and they will be ready to accelerate at lightning speed into all things written, including books, stories, and grade level course material. If your child is already in 3rd grade or higher, they will now have the fundamental reading skills they need to quickly catch up to their grade level course material. The app works because it teaches \\\"phonological (sound) awareness\\\" FIRST, allowing the developing brain to create a \\\"neural map\\\" of the 44 unique sounds of English via the use of child-friendly, pictograms, or, \\\"sound symbols.\\\" The app works because it first shows children that each sound can be represented as a symbol; and then it shows children that these sound symbols can be blended together to form the very same words that we use in our everyday conversations. Children begin to recognize that sound symbols are the pictorial representations of our spoken language, and the fundamental building blocks of written code. The app works because it introduces English much later in the reading process (4 hours later). English spelling patterns like \\\"ee\\\" and \\\"ea,\\\" etc. are equated to one of the 44 building blocks of sound that the student is now already familiar with. When the app introduces English, it does so by showing children ALL of the pieces of a given word and how the sound of each piece (\\\"phonics\\\") is easily revealed by the Magic Decoder (the diacritic symbols they already know, strategically positioned above the word.) The app works because it teaches ALL of the fundamentals of reading in the RIGHT order. And the app works because it provides children with a \\\"touch of the button\\\" pronunciation guide, and teaches them how to interpret that pronunciation guide. It&rsquo;s like a set of training wheels. Children learn using the diacritics, but once they have seen a word a few times, they no longer need them. By the end of the app, children are essentially weaned off of the diacritics except where new, \\\"novel\\\" words are introduced, words that they have never seen before. For new words, students always have the FUNetix button available so they never have to ask a parent or teacher or older sibling how to decode it. They can do it themselves! And if it&rsquo;s a word they already know the meaning of, they immediately make the association and UNDERSTAND the context in which it is being used. So if you have 12 hours that you would like to donate to this cause, we are looking for up to 1,000 early users. We hope that you and your child have an incredible experience learning how to read with the patented \\\"FUNetix 12 Hour Literacy App!\\\" And we hope that your child becomes a lifelong reader like so many other children who have learned how to read using the FUNetix curriculum. And we hope that your candid feedback will help us make this app as fun and interesting and enjoyable as possible for millions of children who will use it after Thanksgiving, 2020. And of course this is all FREE. We are a 501 (c) (3) charitable non-profit, and we are giving this app away to the world, for FREE! That&rsquo;s our purpose and our mission! To sign up, simply go to www.FUNetix.org .

A pioneering nonprofit, Heifer International, has shown that nonprofits can capture some of that money by making donations, given in a friend&rsquo;s name, feel like a present. It works! They raise $115 million a year this way. Imagine how much more gift money could be captured by nonprofits addressing popular causes, including your favorites. The challenge is that it is too daunting for most nonprofits to provide a gift-like experience: tangible donation opportunities, wish lists, gift registries, and personalized printed greeting cards. About www.ChangingThePresent.org Our nonprofit site provides a gift-like experience, which helps 400 leading nonprofits capture money normally spent on traditional presents. The NY Times called it an \\\"amazon.com of the nonprofit world.\\\" We are now about to invite all million nonprofits to join the site. We are also providing each with their own private, charitable gift sites so they can send supporters without exposing them to other nonprofits. See a sample: http://SampleNGO.GiftsForHumanity.org. We facilitate this type of giving for individuals and nonprofits, and we promote this as a social norm. The Environment This is a great place to work.

We offer four great benefits: Take on a leadership role Enhance your resume Make a difference Generate funds for college tuition and textbooks We are looking for passionate, energetic students with exceptional skills. This is an outstanding leadership opportunity in an innovative start-up nonprofit organization. About ClassWish ClassWish is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in NYC and working nationwide. Our initial focus was in providing resources for K-12 students. We are now turning attention to help generate funds for nonprofits and for college tuition and textbooks, as well. We offer high-achieving students unparalleled opportunities to assume responsibility, use their skills, gain experience, and make a difference--and provide relief from the cost of college tuition and textbooks. Here are the problems we are tackling: We are tackling two problems at once: Nonprofits need far more funding to fulfill their missions, and schools need far more resources for kids (books, computers, art supplies, musical instruments, science equipment, and sports equipment are all in desperately short supply). Students and their families are burdened by the skyrocketing cost of college tuition and textbooks. (By the way, be sure to see www.TuitionRevolution.org). Our Approach ClassWish is launching a new initiative to address these needs. Soon, students and their families will be able to earn an average of 8% of what they spend at stores, grocers, gas stations, restaurants, hotels, and airlines, and they will be able to direct that to their favorite schools, teachers, nonprofits, or even their own tuition and textbooks. What Campus Reps Will Do ClassWish Campus Reps will help raise awareness of this opportunity for students, professors, and their families to generate funding for schools, nonprofits, and college tuition. We will recruit a campus rep on each college campus. They, in turn, will recruit additional campus reps to focus on each of these areas: Greek life Residence halls Athletics Student government Student clubs and organizations Professors and administration Alumni Student media Social media Events Graphics Communications Marketing We Want to Hear From Outstanding Students Interested in becoming a Campus Rep?

We are looking for entrepreneurial, creative, passionate, and energetic students with exceptional skills to take initiative on a range of fashion marketing projects. This is an outstanding leadership opportunity in an innovative, emerging nonprofit. Here is the problem we are tackling: K-12 schools in this country do not have enough resources for children to explore their potential and excel. Books, computers, art supplies, musical instruments, science equipment, sports equipment, and even paper for computers and printers are all in desperately short supply. Our Approach: ClassWish . org, an exciting nonprofit, uses modern business practices and the latest marketing techniques to help generate funding to provide needed resources to 56 million kids at 125,000 schools. Teachers visit the site to create Wish Lists of the resources they need. People in the community can see exactly what is needed and contribute to help. Our Cause Marketing campaigns generate funding and awareness. About Us: The people behind ClassWish.org include such prominent education and business leaders as the: former COO of Mashable; EVP of the New York Stock Exchange; former CEO of Huffington Post; former Provost of Harvard; CEO of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute; Director of the Institute for Advanced Study; Director, Education and Society Program of Aspen Institute; CEO of the American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education. Most importantly, current and former interns will offer a great review of ClassWish.org. Fashion: Teachers and students are already getting supplies from ClassWish.org. Now, we need to raise greater awareness and funding so we can encourage more participation and help more kids. The fashion industry is a key element of that. We are engaging with the Fashion industry, as follows: We will invite famous fashion designers to participate in the celebrity section of ClassWish. They will get their own page, where they can lend their voice to providing children with art suppleis and other resources; honor their own favorite teacher; and link to other fashion icons who are doing the same. They will also appear on web banner ads that we design specifically for each of them. We will secure donated ad inventory from fashion magazines, websites, blogs, schools, and retailers. The ClassWish PSA ads will feature the celebrities involved in the program. We will build Cause Marketing and promotional campaigns with fashion brands and retailers. For instance, we are working on one campaign now: 'Win a wardrobe for yourself and one for your favorite teacher.&rsquo; We will seek editorial coverage of the campaign from fashion magazines and websites. We will use social media to reinforce these campaigns. We are a small organization, so we seek outstanding students who can take a leadership role. They will work in small teams and with our co-founder and other professionals. The fashion program is a new one for us, so this is a ground-floor opportunity. The Environment: This is, frankly, a great place to work. We get great interns from all over the country and all over the world, so the atmosphere is energetic, creative, and fun. You will see at the link below that former interns offer a great review of ClassWish.org. What do we offer? You will enhance your resume with a solid record of professional achievement and community service, work with great people, and have the satisfaction of knowing that you have helped children get the tools they need to perform at their best.

We are looking for entrepreneurial, passionate, and energetic students with exceptional skills. This is an outstanding leadership opportunity in an innovative start-up nonprofit. Here is the problem we are tackling: K-12 schools in this country do not have enough resources to let children explore their potential and excel. Books, computers, art supplies, musical instruments, science equipment, sports equipment, and even paper for computers and printers are all in desperately short supply. Our Approach: ClassWish . org, an exciting new nonprofit, uses modern business practices and the latest marketing techniques to help 125,000 schools serving 56 million kids, inform, inspire and engage supporters.

Yo-Yo Ma, Tony Hawk and Dwight Howard are among the celebrities who have offered to help promote ClassWish.org. Most importantly, current and former interns will offer a great review of ClassWish.org. The work: Teachers and students are already getting supplies from ClassWish.org. Now, we need to raise greater awareness and encourage more participation so we can help more kids. Campus Reps will promote various campaigns at their colleges. The first to launch is a micro-philanthropy program, which you can read about at http://ThankTheTeachers.org. College students are writing notes to former K-12 teachers to thank them for their support and to let them know of ClassWish.org, at the same time. This is a great way for teachers to learn of the opportunity to get needed resources, and it is a quick and easy way for college students to make a difference. Imagine how many teachers we could reach if even 25% of the students at your college each took just a couple of minutes to write to former teachers. Campus Reps will promote Thank The Teachers on their campus, using a combination of direct outreach, social media, and other communications tools. What do we offer? You will enhance your resume with a solid record of professional achievement and community service, and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you have helped children get the tools they need to perform at their best.

Use your skills and also improve the education and lives of schoolchildren and to make school fundraising easier and more efficient than ever. We are looking for passionate, energetic students with exceptional skills. This is an outstanding leadership opportunity in an innovative start-up nonprofit organization. Here is the problem we are tackling: K-12 schools in this country do not have enough resources to let children explore their potential and excel. Books, computers, art supplies, musical instruments, science equipment, sports equipment, and even paper for computers and printers are all in desperately short supply. Our Approach: ClassWish . org, an exciting new nonprofit, uses modern business practices and the latest marketing techniques to help 125,000 schools serving 56 million kids, inform, inspire and engage supporters. Teachers visit the site to create Wish Lists of the resources they need. People in the community can see exactly what is needed and contribute to help. About Us: The people behind ClassWish.org include such prominent education and business leaders as Adam Hirsch, former COO, Mashable; Laurie Coots, CMO, TBWA; Scott Cutler, EVP, New York Stock Exchange; Betsy Morgan, former CEO, Huffington Post; Nancy Pelz-Paget, Director, Education and Society Program, Aspen Institute; Sharon Robinson, CEO, American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education.

The work: We are looking for an outstanding bookkeeping intern to help us with financial reporting, controls and systems. You will take a leadership role on projects and work with other highly motivated interns, established professionals, and directly with our co-founder. What do we offer? You will enhance your resume with a solid record of professional achievement and community service, and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you have helped children get the tools they need to perform at their best. If you want a great experience doing something you will always be proud of, send a cover letter and a resume to interns @ ClassWish . org. Impress us. This is competitive. FAQ Is this a business or a nonprofit? We are a nonprofit, but we use the latest techniques from the business world to make a leveraged, scalable and financially-self sustaining difference in the lives of tens of millions of schoolchildren. This sounds ambitious! Daniel Burnham, the great Chicago architect, said \\\"Make no little plans; they have not the power to stir men&rsquo;s souls.\\\" (Nor women&rsquo;s, we hasten to add). Little plans also do not have the power to provide a better education to 56 million kids who deserve more than they are getting today. We face a crushing need in schools, have a solid plan to address it, and with your help, we intend to grow this very large and very fast. Where are you located? We are in Manhattan, conveniently located right across from Madison Square Garden. Four express subway stops are within one block. We will also hire interns to work remotely from other cities (but for other roles, not bookkeeping). What skills and experience are you looking for? This posting is for a bookkeeping intern. We also seek interns with a wide range of skills: graphic designers, videographers, writers, researchers, creative thinkers, analytical sorts, community organizers, social media stars, people with great communication skills, MBA students, and more.

We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your resum\u00e9, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions. When will you select the interns? We&rsquo;re agile. When we see a great candidate, we extend an invitation immediately. We won&rsquo;t keep you waiting for a decision. What dates will the internship run? We are hiring for the fall semester, for the summer, and beyond. What are the hours? We welcome full-time and part-time interns. Let us know what works for you.

Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed.

Our Girl Scout ESL troops allow girls to practice English while having fun and learning Girl Scout traditions. You choose the meeting dates and times, we help you with training and resources.

DID YOU KNOW 90% OF LATINA GIRLS WANT TO BE LEADERS BUT ONLY 10% OF GIRLS FEEL SHE HAS WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A LEADER? YOU can change this! The Girl Scout experience gives every girl the confidence and personal leadership skills she needs to realize her full potential. Girl Scouts are more successful in school, relationships, and careers; and they achieve more for their families, their community, and their country than non-Girl Scouts. By bringing together girls from different cultures, Girl Scouts gives them a place to celebrate their own heritage and learn about others, which creates a sense of pride and understanding. Both qualities-pride and understanding-serve girls well throughout their lives. Who can start a troop? Just about anyone! Parents, teachers, professionals, college students, military personnel, women or men. As a new leader, you&rsquo;ll receive plenty of training and resources to get started - no experience required. What&rsquo;s the leader's role? With the help of a strong support team and useful materials, a leader holds meetings for their troop of girls. Meetings are an hour or two, and usually consist of skill-building and badge earning activities. Leaders also communicate with troop parents and their local Girl Scout support team for any help they might need. How much time will this take? It's up to you! You decide how many times your troop meets. The time you give as a troop leader is valuable to us, and we'll give you tools that let you make the most of it. On average, leaders commit five hours per month, with room to grow if you choose to do additional activities.

CASA was created to make sure the abuse and neglect these children originally suffered in the home doesn't continue as abuse and neglect at the hands of the system. As trained advocates, CASA volunteers get to know children in foster care and talk with their caregivers, schools, therapists, and other professionals, in order to gather information about their wellbeing and advocate for them in court.

Feel free to also check us out on our website to learn more about us at www.TEACH4Kids.org Who We Are: TEACH (Together Educating All Children in Hospitals) is an international not-for-profit organization that brings exciting, hands-on, STEM educational programming to children in hospitals. Our mission is to create an outlet for children of all ages to passionately engage with the sciences through the medium of fun, interactive experiments. Through engagement with practical science concepts, the children are challenged yet empowered. They emerge comforted and confident, encouraged to successfully cope with the trials that lie before them. TEACH modules challenge children to think creatively and bring an element of fun to an otherwise monotonous day. When TEACH volunteers visit, children get excited and get to experience STEM topics through more than 75 different interactive modules. Patients can learn about real life concepts while also having an exceptional amount of fun. They are amazed as they create silly putty while they learn about polymers and use basic engineering principles to build boats that really float. Observing the science of physiological respiration using yeast to inflate a balloon or discovering density by creating their very own lava lamps truly changes the way they view science, their stay in the hospital and life. What makes us special is that TEACH was founded by and is entirely run by students. In Spring 2013, TEACH&rsquo;s two co-founders were inspired to help with the need for interaction and activity, the craving for a personal bond, and the lack of mental and physical stimulation exhibited by hospitalized children. Under the mentorship and guidance of Dr. Edward Burns of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, TEACH was created to heal through teaching. TEACH began with monthly modules in a local Bronx hospital. In just over a year, TEACH grew to reach nine hospitals with hundreds of students signed up to volunteer from various universities around the tristate area. We have served over 3000 children, 30 hospitals internationally, and 1000 volunteers. What TEACH Needs TEACH is seeking an enthusiastic and passionate individual that wants to make a difference in the lives of medically ill children. We need someone who is committed to the organization both in the time they commit to as well as a financial responsibility to support the organization. Our Advisory board members are required to be active within the organization and play a significant role in the growth of the organization. Advisory Board Member Responsibilities TEACH Advisory board will meet periodically and communicates via email and phone at various times throughout the year. Advisory Board members are required to assist fundraising efforts and participate in at least one committee. Some of the things that they would need to participate in would be to promote events, participate in peer to peer campaigns, help with corporate partnerships and networking. The board member must always be an advocate for the organization and represent the organization always.", "title": "TEACH Advisory Board Member- NJ slot.", "zipcode": "08901", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D3171509%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "TEACH TOGETHER EDUCATING ALL CHILDREN IN HOSPITALS INC"}, {"end": null, "description": "Every year more than half a million abused and neglected children are in need of safe, permanent, nurturing homes.
