With your help, we can equip students with the foundational skills they need to read at grade level. Each week, you will meet one-on-one with your student every week to help them develop strong literacy skills and discover a passion for reading.

We'll need teen volunteers to help us with Gingerbread House Day, Morning with Santa and Pajama Storytime in December. Email dlampertrudman@morven.org for orientation dates and details! About The Museum A National Historic Landmark, Morven is situated on five pristine acres in the heart of Princeton, New Jersey. This former New Jersey Governor&rsquo;s Mansion showcases the rich cultural heritage of the Garden State through regular exhibitions, educational programs and special events. History Home to one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence and to five New Jersey governors, Morven has played a role in the history of New Jersey and the nation for more than 250 years. Richard Stockton (1730-1781) built Morven in the 1750s on land granted to his grandfather by William Penn in 1701. After a fire in 1758, the home was rebuilt and christened Morven, (\\\"big mountain\\\" in Gaelic) by Richard&rsquo;s wife Annis Boudinot Stockton (1736-1801). Richard was a graduate of the first class of The College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) and became a prominent lawyer. He was one of five New Jersey delegates appointed to the Continental Congress where he signed the Declaration of Independence. The British ransacked Morven later that year, capturing and imprisoning Stockton. He was released in January 1777. Annis is one of America&rsquo;s earliest published female poets, immortalizing heroes of the Revolution such as George Washington, who called her \\\"the elegant Muse of Morven.\\\" Four more generations of Stocktons resided at Morven through the early 20th century before the property was leased to General Robert Wood Johnson, Chairman of Johnson & Johnson and the first non-family member to live there (1928-1944). He was followed by five New Jersey governors when Morven served as the state&rsquo;s first Governor&rsquo;s Mansion (1945-1981). After the Governor&rsquo;s Mansion was relocated in 1982, Morven went through an extensive restoration and archaeological investigation. Morven re-opened as a museum and garden in 2004. Restoration An unprecedented public and private partnership coupled with an extensive document search and archaeological excavation provided the foundation for a comprehensive renovation of Morven that began in 1999. The program restored historic features of the grounds, including an 18th-century horse chestnut walk and a colonial revival garden. The buildings were returned to original colors, 20th century alterations were removed, and historic features, such as the renowned parquet floors, were re-installed. An extensive nine-zone environmental system allows the museum to individually regulate temperature and humidity in each gallery, and security, lighting, fire suppression, and handicap-accessibility systems place Morven at the forefront of industry standards for museums. Currently under construction, Morven&rsquo;s Stockton Education Center is set to open in Spring 2018. Morven Museum & Garden has become known for exceptional programming that expands and illuminates the themes presented in the permanent collection and special exhibitions. The new building will allow us to deliver these offerings steps away from the national historic home and galleries, allowing for seamless connections between the program topics and material culture. With improved space, Morven will be better able to serve our growing audience including families with children, improve our community partnerships, and offer a gracious setting for events in a state of the art facility that opens to the beautiful Colonial Revival Garden.

Here is an opportunity to help underprivileged children, to help under-served children, to help ALL children, and to help adults who can't read. You can be a part of an amazing convergence of forces that is about to change the literacy paradigm in the United States. Two years ago, the Barbara Bush Foundation and Dollar General sponsored two multi-million dollar XPrize competitions, one for Adult Literacy in America and one for children's literacy in Africa. That has sparked a race to build an app that works on any smartphone and that can teach children how to read without any required input from adults. For an incredibly interesting TED talk that some say prompted this entire movement, see Sugata Mitra: Kids can teach themselves. The American Youth Literacy Foundation is a nationwide 501 (c) (3) charitable non-profit that has been teaching thousands of kids how to read over the past 10 years through a nationwide network of high school and college student reading tutors. Now we are literally only a few months away from completing the beta version of our new literacy app called FUNetix(r), that will teach children how to read whether or not an adult is present. Our goal is to finish, then test this beta version in real world environments with real kids who are learning how to read. We will obtain critical feedback and gain critical insight that will enable us to refine our app from beta to V 1.0 and make it available for FREE, global download and distribution through the Apple store, Google play and other venues. Now we are looking for a few, dedicated, creative, talented people who are willing to help with this project. Especially helpful would be Adobe Illustrator skills. You may also be interested in learning how to build an app using an easy app generator/ prototyping tool called Ionic Creator. You can make a huge difference in helping us solve the literacy crisis by joining our team. This has been and will continue to be an incredibly exciting and rewarding experience for a small group of people. If this is something that you feel passionate about and want to get involved in, then please reply today. We need your help. Your contribution in the development of this app, could make a difference in literally, millions of lives. Thank you!

It happens because you demand it to happen. As a RESULTS volunteer, you will learn how to be an effective advocate in the fight against poverty. Practically, that means: *Learning how to develop a relationship with your member of Congress so that when you get in touch, they listen. *Developing media skills so you can write punchy, persuasive opinion pieces and convince editorial boards to write about RESULTS issues. *Joining a movement of people committed to ending the systemic and structural injustices that drive poverty. *Meeting with your RESULTS group monthly for training, updates, and action. *Taking your message and skills straight to Capitol Hill.

Medical and TB test need to be updated by the tutor annually. References, resumee, criminal records check and various other paperwork are also required. Each new volunteer tutor is interviewed to determine his or her areas of academic strength and interest. The Tutoring Coordinator, Steven Shooman, then matches the strengths, motivations, and availability of the potential tutors with the needs and personalities of the students who have applied. Most tutors meet their students once a week, with sessions lasting one hour. This usually occurs during after school hours, that is Monday through Friday from 3:00 to 6:00.

WHY A NEED FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS? -Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect to patients who have served our country. -Veterans share a common bond and code of conduct. -The camaraderie that exists between Veterans has proven to be a great support for the Veterans we care for. As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee. If you are interested or have questions please contact the Grace Healthcare Services Volunteer Department at 732-225-4100 and ask for Ms. Moynihan to inquire about the Veteran-to-Veteran Volunteer Program.

It happens because you demand it to happen. As a RESULTS volunteer, you will learn how to be an effective advocate in the fight against poverty. Practically, that means: *Learning how to develop a relationship with your member of Congress so that when you get in touch, they listen. *Developing media skills so you can write punchy, persuasive opinion pieces and convince editorial boards to write about RESULTS issues. *Joining a movement of people committed to ending the systemic and structural injustices that drive poverty. *Meeting with your RESULTS group monthly for training, updates, and action. *Taking your message and skills straight to Capitol Hill.

Sprout leaders' primary goal is to give adults with developmental disabilities the opportunity to experience and enjoy recreational, educational and leisure activities through overnight vacations. Leaders are responsible for the overall safety and enjoyment of their group, 24 hours a day, while on a Sprout trip. Duties include safety monitoring, personal hygiene assistance, providing physical and emotional support, activity planning, budgeting, logistics, and enhancing fun. The work is hard yet immensely rewarding as you develop leadership skills and gain insight into your own abilities. What type of training is provided? Leaders must complete a pre-service training, which provides the necessary procedures and tools to run a successful and enjoyable vacation. Leaders who are drivers receive extra training on how to safely drive our 15-passenger vans. In addition, all leaders receive a copy of Sprout's Leadership Handbook to help with policies and guidelines. What is the time commitment? Sprout vacations last 3 - 7 days depending on the time of year and destination of the trip. When a leader is selected for an overnight vacation, Sprout asks that the leader dedicate themselves to stay with their group throughout the entire duration of the vacation. Some leaders only choose to lead one trip a year while others spend several months with us leading up to 8 trips or more. Sprout strives to make our program flexible for our leaders based on the amount of time leaders can give. Do leaders have any free or personal time while on a trip? Sprout trips are working vacations for the leaders who choose to participate. Because Sprout leaders are responsible for their group 24 hours a day, there is no free or personal time allotted. In order to give our participants the opportunity to experience and enjoy a vacation, Sprout leaders must be available at all times to provide the support any one participant may need. What type of trips can Sprout leaders expect to join? A majority of Sprout trips take place within a day's drive of New York City. Destinations include Atlantic City, Amish Country, Boston, Lake George, Cleveland, Maine and Virginia Beach. Exotic trips like cruises, Hawaii, and Europe are presented to leaders who have demonstrated high levels of commitment, service hours and have gained positive feedback from participants and Sprout office staff. Are there any special skills or requirements? No special background or education is required to become a Sprout leader. We encourage people from all cultures and professions, and of all ethnic and educational backgrounds. Once accepted into the program, you will receive the necessary tools to sign up for outings and how to assist our participants. Requirements include: -21+ years old -Provide references -Participate in training session -Willingness to complete necessary background checks -Evaluate participants' behavior -Fluent English -Willing to drive a 15 passenger van -Love to travel & have fun!

Got your attention! In late January/early February 2019, Community Tax Aid (CTA) will train volunteers to prepare tax forms (federal, state and local) for low income tax payers. Volunteers will then serve in either the morning, afternoon or evening once per week at one of our pop-up volunteering sites. Our sites are in all boroughs except S.I. We provide tax preparation for free to low-income taxpayers starting in mid-Feb. and continue through Mid-April. We are different from other free tax prep organizations in that our training (when accompanied with volunteer tax preparation) qualifies for CPE credit for CPA's - a definite benefit for the volunteer. Also, a benefit for tax payers is that we can file out of state and prior year forms, some forms not handled by VITA and other IRS free prep sites, and we also have people available year round if needed for follow-up tax info. Many of our clients have been with us for many years. Whether or not you experience filling out tax forms, we will train you until you are comfortable preparing tax returns for our clients. Our volunteers come from all walks of life. Many of our sites are handicapped accessible. This opportunity is sponsored by: Community Tax Aid, Inc. We need volunteers who are free at these times: Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday evenings 6-9 PM or Saturdays 10-1 or 1-4PM or Sundays 1-5 PM This volunteer opportunity is available to the following types of volunteers: adults, especially those with tax experience, lawyers, accountants and accounting students.

Mentors can play an important role as the youth develops mentally and emotionally to help a youth understand their goals and personal needs. Mentors must be a minimum of 18 years of age. Prospective mentors will undergo an intensive screening process consisting of: application and informal autobiography, personal interview, reference checks, criminal background check, driving record check and program orientation.

Therefore, we create Memory Books, in which we categorize items such as food, holidays, sports, cars, flowers/gardens, people, people showing emotion such as hugs, etc. Volunteers create these books by finding and cutting out pictures or scenes from magazines, cards, calendars, etc. We sit with the patients and review these categories to see if any memory is stimulated and many times it is. We have had great results with this over the years as a tool for the mental stimulation for these patients. It takes a lot of time, hours and dedication to put these books together and a great deal of material is needed to complete them. This is truly a community project that touches and adds to the quality of life for our patients. Grace Healthcare Services is happy to provide all materials needed to make these books. The books can be made from the comfort of your own group setting! We will arrange for the Volunteer Coordinator to drop off and pick up supplies.

Grace Healthcare Services is a Community-based Hospice program that cares for Veterans at the end of life. Volunteers are an essential component of this care.

As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee.

It happens because you demand it to happen. As a RESULTS volunteer, you will learn how to be an effective advocate in the fight against poverty. Practically, that means: *Learning how to develop a relationship with your member of Congress so that when you get in touch, they listen. *Developing media skills so you can write punchy, persuasive opinion pieces and convince editorial boards to write about RESULTS issues. *Joining a movement of people committed to ending the systemic and structural injustices that drive poverty. *Meeting with your RESULTS group monthly for training, updates, and action. *Taking your message and skills straight to Capitol Hill. Our staff is based in Washington D.C. and we have community chapters across the United States. Learn more at results.org. What are you waiting for? Start influencing the policies that impact your life and the lives of millions of people around the world. Become a RESULTS advocate.

WE NEED TUTORS RIGHT NOW to start supporting underserved children so they can build skills to do well on standardized tests and for entry into competitive, quality middle and high schools. Every weekend and free time you can give, let us know. We will assign you a child and you must be dedicated to that student at least three months. You can share the responsibility with another, but it must be intense and helpful for aspiring, hardworking students who come from underserved schools. Hours - At Grand Army Library - anytime between 9 am and 6 pm on Saturdays and 1-5 pm on Sundays. We can find other times and other locations. Children come from central Brooklyn (Crown Heights, etc) Background - We have an initiative with Seeds in the Middle to give every child a chance to learn the academic skills to gain entry into New York City's top high schools - starting as early as 3rd or 4th grade. Why? Despite increasing funding and initiatives, the percentage of African-American and Latino students in NYC is far below their numbers in the NYC population. See the article here - showing in 2017 that only 10 percent of the seats offered went to minority students. https://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2017/03/08/only-10-percent-of-offers-at-new-york-citys-specialized-high-schools-went-to-black-and-hispanic-students/ Who are we? Seeds in the Middle has been working with students, faculties and parents and the community in central Brooklyn since 2010. We have seen the challenges and want to work closely with people who care to give children real chances to get the same access to top colleges as those in more affluent communities. We think we have an innovative solution to helping students achieve so they can have an equal shot at these schools - including competitive schools like LaGuardia High School of Performing Arts or Midwood or Murrow or any other school recognized as top by the most competitive colleges. That's you! Help us create a new pathway for students! Empower real change. THIS FALL - Volunteers who can help prepare students for the Specialized High School test are asked to commit at least two hours a week end until the test which will be held in October or early November. ATTENTION - beyond this fall test, if you want to tutor younger ages or do anything further, read below For the long-term plan, WE ask for commitments of at least three months, or you can work for years with a student on special skills. You must: sign that commitment when you finish your term, explain to the next tutor what you are working on with the student confer with our certified educators for guidance so you know exactly what they need to work on. STUDENTS - WE CAN GIVE COMMUNITY SERVICE HOURS FOR THIS. Locations? May vary - it might be Brooklyn Central Library near Grand Army Plaza or a school in Brownsville, Flatbush or Crown Heights, Brooklyn or maybe right at Stuyvesant High School or one of the top high schools. If you have a location near a train, let us know. Who are the students you will tutor? Each student must write a letter or essay, saying why he or she wants to go to a top high school and signing, with a parent, their commitment to coming every week for as long as it takes. We are starting at 3rd or 4th grade, and offer this to students through 8th grade. We hope to launch this on MLK weekend 2018 - so respond right away. PS - We would like to ask every volunteer to donate $50 or anything to help support our efforts. If you just want to tutor and cannot give, that is okay. But this is an unfunded program, so we are asking for donations to pay the people who are creating and organizing these opportunities and to administer this. All donations are tax-deductible. If you are willing to fundraise at all - even a bake sale - for our efforts, we would truly appreciate. Our goal is $20,000 and we want to offer tutors to as many children who want it - can be 100 or more... you can see what we do at seedsinthemiddle.org and on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/seedsinthemiddle/ What is our goal? To get at least 20 students into any of these schools, maybe more. But our initial goal is to ensure at least 20 students get the education necessary to pass the specialized high school test or other tests to go to the school of their choice - who - WITHOUT YOU - would never get a chance to get in. More info? Email - info@seedsinthemiddle.org Please write us and tell us: Who you are Days you are available What is your commitment - how many weeks at 2 x a week Where are you willing to travel?

At the end of the evening, you will have provided young people with the affirmation they need to call themselves writers - and you'll have shared some laughs, and maybe tears, from the stories. Story Love evenings are entertaining as well as productive. WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW: Story Pirates has been providing arts education - and giving Story Love - since 2003.

Health Action League implements comprehensive and impactful health and wellness programs at schools and youth organizations to further advance the well-being and academic performance of our students. Youth in low-income New York City neighborhoods have limited access to organized sports, gyms, healthy food options, and other resources that promote health and wellness. As a result, young people in these neighborhoods have poorer health compared to their high-income peers. This is unfair and avoidable; a child&rsquo;s health should not be determined by their zip code.

Our mission is to create an outlet for children of all ages to passionately engage with the sciences through the medium of fun, interactive experiments. Through engagement with practical science concepts, the children are challenged yet empowered. They emerge comforted and confident, encouraged to successfully cope with the trials that lie before them. TEACH modules challenge children to think creatively and bring an element of fun to an otherwise monotonous day. When TEACH volunteers visit, children get excited and get to experience STEM topics through more than 75 different interactive modules. Patients can learn about real life concepts while also having an exceptional amount of fun. They are amazed as they create silly putty while they learn about polymers and use basic engineering principles to build boats that really float. Observing the science of physiological respiration using yeast to inflate a balloon or discovering density by creating their very own lava lamps truly changes the way they view science, their stay in the hospital and life. What makes us special is that TEACH was founded by and is entirely run by students. In Spring 2013, TEACH&rsquo;s two co-founders were inspired to help with the need for interaction and activity, the craving for a personal bond, and the lack of mental and physical stimulation exhibited by hospitalized children. Under the mentorship and guidance of Dr. Edward Burns of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, TEACH was created to heal through teaching. TEACH began with monthly modules in a local Bronx hospital. In just over a year, TEACH grew to reach nine hospitals with hundreds of students signed up to volunteer from various universities around the tristate area. We have served 2400 children, 30 hospitals internationally, and 1000 volunteers. What TEACH Needs TEACH is seeking an enthusiastic and passionate individual that wants to make a difference in the lives of medically ill children. We need someone who is committed to the organization both in the time they commit to as well as a financial responsibility to support the organization. Our board members are required to be active within the organization and play a significant role in the growth of the organization. Board Member Responsibilities TEACH board meets twice a year and communicates via email and phone at various times throughout the year. We require board members to attend both meetings. Board members are required to assist fundraising efforts and participate in at least one committee. Some of the things that they would need to participate in would be to promote events, participate in peer to peer campaigns, in addition they would be required to either give a minimum of $500 to the organization personally or solicit donations for the organization. If the board members can give or get more it is welcomed.

This can serve 58,064,516,129 meals using the national average amount spent on a meal, $2.79. In order to address this issue of waster, Rescuing Leftover Cuisine helps bring food from our partners to a local homeless shelter. It takes less than an hour and you can set your own schedule, whether you want to help out daily, weekly, or sporadically. Our events at Rescuing Leftover Cuisine typically last 30 minutes (Some events are longer, some are shorter). On each event, we rescue an average of 50 pounds of food, which feeds about 40 people. It only take 30 minutes to help feed over 40 people! WHAT WE'LL BE DOING: Help rescue some prepared food and drinks from a restaurant in the Financial District! We will deliver the food to the NYC Rescue Mission, located at 90 Lafayette St, New York NY 10013 Mediumweight: the average amount of food rescued from this event is 20-40 pounds. WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW: This event meets rain or shine, so please dress appropriately! WHERE TO MEET: 67 Wall Street, New York, NY 10005 1133 Broadway, New York, NY 10010 RESCUING LEFTOVER CUISINE: Rescuing Leftover Cuisine is a national 501(c)3 non-profit food rescue organization, operating in 16 cities and headquartered in New York City, that provides solutions to prevent excess wholesome cuisine from being wasted. RLC provides services such as food waste consulting, excess food delivery, co-branding services, and tax credit assistance. RLC approaches the two large issues of hunger and food waste in three main ways. First, we localize the issues into sets of communities that can help sustain themselves. We crowdsource the solution of the transportation to the members of the public in these communities as volunteers. After identifying the homeless shelters of a needy community, we proactively find restaurants, hotels, and catering companies with excess food in that vicinity that could help support these disadvantaged communities. Second, we leverage technology to facilitate the identification and handling of excess food. Thus, partner food providers report when excess food is occurring and a web application is used to engage community members, because volunteering with us can be as easy as taking a brisk walk. Third, we tackle food waste at its root, aiming to eliminate as much food waste as possible and bringing the remaining excess food to where it is needed most. The data of when food waste occurs is used in our analysis of what types of food waste could be avoided, and RLC suggests ways that partner food providers can reduce waste at its root.", "title": "Volunteer with One Brick and Rescuing Leftover Cuisine", "zipcode": "10013", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D3020298%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "ONE BRICK"}, {"end": "2018-12-31", "description": "Interested in shooting on the Red Carpet for a celebrity gala?

Volunteer Kenya - ICODEI is a non-religious, non-political volunteer organization run through a partnership of past overseas volunteers and local Kenyans. Our Microenterprise Development Program is our newest program. We have been active in helping set up small income-generating activities (IGA) for rural self-help groups since the early 2000's (primarily thru grants), but only recently began focusing our work on providing more advice, consulting assistance, and small loans to the groups. MDP volunteers work with the existing microenterprise groups to help them grow and improve their existing projects, as well as help newly forming groups start an IGA. The 5 main areas of volunteer activity in the MDP are as follows: \u2022 Progress Assessment \u2022 Facilitate a Group Project Discussion / Evaluation and Provide Project Advice \u2022 Facilitate Knowledge and Resource Sharing Within the Network of Groups \u2022 Provide Small Loans \u2022 Provide General Business Skills Training Seminars Most volunteers spend their time doing a combination of all the above 5 items. Our value-added is not just in the form of providing financial resources (loans) but includes project planning advice, basic management and accounting training, and (very importantly) volunteers act as facilitators between our vast network of groups in order to facilitate knowledge and resource sharing among the groups. Our pilot microlending program has just gotten off the ground during the last several months and we currently have about $10,000 USD in outstanding loans. The MDP volunteers will be spending a lot of their time over the next several months meeting with the loans groups to ensure that are on schedule with paying back their loans and that they are investing their money prudently (e.g., in productivity enhancing resources versus consumption items). As the loans are repaid, the volunteers then give them out in the form of new loans to other groups. We have a very large backlog of loan application requests. As a volunteer in the MDP you would spend the vast majority of your time out in the field meeting and working with the women microenterprise groups, which is a very rewarding and educational experience. All of the microenterprise groups within our network are independent groups. We do not manage their day to day operations and do not charge any type of fee for our services. We are a strict volunteer non-for-profit organization. All interest that we receive from the microloans goes towards new loans for additional groups. We are now have a network of around 100 microenterprise groups within the western Kenya region. As of June 2007, our organization has had over 350 volunteers since 1998 from over 6 different countries. Volunteers in our Microenterprise Development have come from a variety of backgrounds including undergrad business students (Duke, Rice, Miami, Indiana), MBA and graduate students on their summer break (Stanford, Penn, etc.), management consultants (BCG, McKinsey, CRA), retired professionals, and accountants.

The Brief was published nationally and showed: \uf0b7 Gross racial and ethnic disparities: approximately 90% are youth of color; 72% are African American males. \uf0b7 Justice by geography: Rates of incarceration in the adult prison system vary significantly across counties in New Jersey, suggesting that justice depends on where one lives, not on the facts of a given case. \uf0b7 Youth are regularly deprived of due process: Approximately 30% of the 472 youth waived to adult court during the study period spent more than 2 years incarcerated, between their arrest date and their sentencing date, violating their right to a speedy trial. \uf0b7 Youth are regularly put in solitary confinement - especially youth with mental health disorders: Although solitary confinement is known to be psychologically damaging, especially to children, 53% of these youth spent a total of approximately 15,359 days (42 years) in solitary confinement between 2010 and 2015; 5 percent spend over a year there, and about 4 percent spent 2 years or more in solitary. Nearly 70 percent of those placed in solitary had a mental health disorder, with nearly 37% having two or more diagnoses. \uf0b7 Youth suffer abuse while in adult prison: once incarcerated in an adult prison, one in four youth surveyed reported physical abuse; 5% reported sexual abuse. NJPC has also published the first family guide to Navigating the Juvenile Justic: System in New Jersey: A Family GUide which was published nationally.", "title": "NJPC Youth Justice Initiative: Legal Expertise Needed To Help Reform the Juvenile Justice System", "zipcode": "07206", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D1773297%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "New Jersey Parents Caucus, Inc."}, {"end": null, "description": "Have a blast while sharing your knowledge with eager and excited women!

Each year, the Guide Dog Foundation breeds about 300 exceptional puppies, and it's vital that Bosley and other pups like him spend the first year of their lives with surrounded by the love and security of volunteer foster families called puppy walkers. Puppy walkers help Foundation puppies grow up to be confident dogs. What's involved in raising a Guide Dog Foundation puppy? Bosley went to live with his puppy walkers when he was about nine weeks old. He's learning basic obedience and social skills while being exposed to many different situations. People who raise Guide Dog Foundation puppies say it is the most rewarding thing they've ever done. Puppy raisers come from everywhere - stay-at-home moms or dads, teachers, college students, retirees, people with flexible work environments - and are crucial members of the Guide Dog Foundation family. By opening their hearts and homes to a puppy, a puppy raiser plays a crucial role in helping a person with disabilities live an independent life. Every puppy walker family works with a Guide Dog Foundation puppy adviser, who is available to answer questions and offer guidance and support. When he is about 14 months old, Bosley will return to the Guide Dog Foundation's Smithtown campus to begin his training as a guide or service dog. Puppy raisers will admit it's tough to say good-bye, but when they see the pup they raised take its place at the side of someone with disabilities, the ache they feel turns pride. There are puppies waiting now to join your loving home for a chance to start their careers.

We welcome your gifts of time and compassion. Whether you choose to work directly with patients and families or to volunteer in one of many other ways, you can make a profound difference in someone's life, including your own. Volunteers are an integral part of the hospice team. Volunteers are needed in all areas of NJ! Volunteer Opportunities: Companionship Volunteers work directly with patients providing companionship, offering friendly visits, reading to patients, writing letters, offering a gentle touch or sharing a quiet moment. Complementary Volunteers are certified/trained professionals who can provide complementary modalities of reflexology, music, imagery and touch therapies such as Reiki, massage, therapeutic touch and healing hands. Pet Therapy Volunteers provide certified/trained pets who visit with patients. These animals provide loving memories for some and give unconditional love helping our patients feel connected to a larger world. Administrative Volunteers provide help to the staff in our Edison office by assisting with typing, addressing cards, organizing newsletters, creating packets, collating manuals and other varied clerical duties Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, huggable dolls/bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Junior Volunteers consist of groups such as girl/boy scouts or young people who wish to honor our patients by making holiday cards, posters, wall hangings and memory books. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families and friends of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network. Hospice training classes are required for Companionship and Complementary Volunteers. They are free of charge and offered on an ongoing basis. Grace Healthcare Services serves counties throughout New Jersey. Areas where you are needed include: Atlantic County, Bergen County, Cape May County, Essex County, Hudson County, Mercer County, Middlesex County, Monmouth County, Morris County, North Passaic County, Ocean County, Somerset County, South Passaic County, Burlington County, Camden County and Union County.

REGISTER HERE: https://www.catholiccharitiesnyvolunteer.org/opportunity/a0C0W00000ujskJ Despite hard work that often includes holding more than one job, many New York residents do not earn enough to pay for food, shelter, and utilities. The needs of struggling families with children, the working poor, frail seniors, and other residents in our communities continue to grow. Catholic Charities wants to help the families we serve have one less thing to worry about and ensure that they have a cheerful holiday season! Through the St. Nicholas Program, Catholic Charities ensures that all individuals and families receive gifts of necessity during the holidays - coats, gloves, blankets and more. In addition, throughout the year, case workers aid these same individuals by providing job coaching, emergency financial assistance to prevent evictions or utility shut-off, food from one of our many food pantries, and school supplies. Last year we were able to assist more than 800 vulnerable families, which included over 4,000 individuals, to receive gifts of necessity for the holidays - coats, gloves, clothing, toys and more. This year, with more people in need turning to Catholic Charities, our goal is to provide gifts to more than 870 families. Volunteers are needed to help support the St. Nicholas Project Shopping Day. T he St. Nicholas Project Shopping Day is a fun-filled day at the Kmart in Astor Place. We will be shopping for approximately 600 families on this day and need your help! Volunteers will be asked to help us \\\"shop\\\" at Kmart to select winter clothing items, process these items through the Kmart registers, and load everything onto Catholic Charities trucks for delivery. Volunteers will: Shop for families (volunteers will receive a family profile and shop for winter items - Catholic Charities provides this budget) Help at the cash registers Bag and sort donation items Load trucks Provide other assistance as needed *We are unable to guarantee that each volunteer will be able to shop for families (earlier shifts will have first priority).* Volunteers will be asked to assist in one or more of these areas. Kmart has changed its store layout, and we will depend on volunteers to help us with moving, bagging and storing items.

Volunteer Kenya / ICODEI is a non-religious, non-political volunteer organization run through a partnership of past overseas volunteers and local Kenyans. Our Microenterprise Development Program is our newest program. We have been active in helping set up small income-generating activities (IGA) for rural self-help groups since the early 2000's (primarily thru grants), but only recently began focusing our work on providing more advice, consulting assistance, and small loans to the groups. MDP volunteers work with the existing microenterprise groups to help them grow and improve their existing projects, as well as help newly forming groups start an IGA. The 5 main areas of volunteer activity in the MDP are as follows: \u2022 Progress Assessment \u2022 Facilitate a Group Project Discussion / Evaluation and Provide Project Advice \u2022 Facilitate Knowledge and Resource Sharing Within the Network of Groups \u2022 Provide Small Loans \u2022 Provide General Business Skills Training Seminars Most volunteers spend their time doing a combination of all the above 5 items. Our value-added is not just in the form of providing financial resources (loans) but includes project planning advice, basic management and accounting training, and (very importantly) volunteers act as facilitators between our vast network of groups in order to facilitate knowledge and resource sharing among the groups. Our pilot microlending program has just gotten off the ground during the last several months and we currently have about $10,000 USD in outstanding loans. The MDP volunteers will be spending a lot of their time over the next several months meeting with the loans groups to ensure that are on schedule with paying back their loans and that they are investing their money prudently (e.g., in productivity enhancing resources versus consumption items). As the loans are repaid, the volunteers then give them out in the form of new loans to other groups. We have a very large backlog of loan application requests. As a volunteer in the MDP you would spend the vast majority of your time out in the field meeting and working with the women microenterprise groups, which is a very rewarding and educational experience. All of the microenterprise groups within our network are independent groups. We do not manage their day to day operations and do not charge any type of fee for our services. We are a strict volunteer non-for-profit organization. All interest that we receive from the microloans goes towards new loans for additional groups. We are now have a network of around 100 microenterprise groups within the western Kenya region.

Consequently, we're always looking for new softball volunteer coaches, particularly those who with experience playing or coaching sports at the college level and beyond. Currently, we have an emphasis and focus on finding more female softball coaches who can teach the game and serve as role models for the girls in our program. We firmly believe that this will play a critical role in impacting the perceptions and future aspirations of our athletes and how they see and understand leadership in the world.

It happens because you tell your members of Congress what you care about and what they can do about it. It happens because you make calls, you write letters, and you go to Capitol Hill. It happens because you demand it to happen. As a RESULTS volunteer, you will learn how to be an effective advocate in the fight against poverty.

Now the real work begins. It&rsquo;s up to you, as a constituent, to hold your new members of Congress accountable. It&rsquo;s up to you to fight for the country and world you want to live in. That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll do as a RESULTS advocate in White Plains . RESULTS is a movement of passionate, committed, everyday people. Together we use our voices to influence political decisions that will bring an end to poverty. We&rsquo;ve been doing this for 38 years, and we know that change doesn&rsquo;t happen just because we vote. It doesn&rsquo;t happen just because there are new faces on Capitol Hill. It happens because you tell your members of Congress what you care about and what they can do about it. It happens because you make calls, you write letters, and you go to Capitol Hill. It happens because you demand it to happen. As a RESULTS volunteer, you will learn how to be an effective advocate in the fight against poverty. Practically, that means: *Learning how to develop a relationship with your member of Congress so that when you get in touch, they listen. *Developing media skills so you can write punchy, persuasive opinion pieces and convince editorial boards to write about RESULTS issues. *Joining a movement of people committed to ending the systemic and structural injustices that drive poverty. *Meeting with your RESULTS group monthly for training, updates, and action. *Taking your message and skills straight to Capitol Hill. Our staff is based in Washington D.C. and we have community chapters across the United States. Learn more at results.org. What are you waiting for?

In Community will reduce isolation by creating a community of children of similar ages who have experienced loss, as well as give them the tools to develop healthy coping skills to adapt to their current and other adversities they may experience.

Complementary Volunteers are certified/trained professionals who can provide complementary modalities of reflexology, music, imagery and touch therapies such as Reiki, massage, therapeutic touch and healing hands.

Administrative Volunteers provide help to the staff in our Edison office by assisting with typing, addressing cards, organizing newsletters, creating packets, collating manuals and other varied clerical duties Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, huggable dolls/bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Junior Volunteers consist of groups such as girl/boy scouts or young people who wish to honor our patients by making holiday cards, posters, wall hangings and memory books.

Guiding Principles As a board member, I understand that I owe duties of care, loyalty, and obedience to the organization and the children it serves. The duty of care is the duty to monitor Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s activities, see that its mission is being accomplished, and guard its financial resources. The duty of loyalty is the duty to avoid conflicts of interest. The duty of obedience is to be faithful to Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s mission and to comply with the law. I will uphold these duties and do my utmost to ensure that Maya&rsquo;s Hope performs its mission and achieves its goals. Principal Commitments Act with integrity and represent the interests of all people served by the organization. Recognize that decisions of the board can be made only by a majority vote at a) a board meeting or b) in writing. Respect the majority decisions of the board. Participate in: Board self-evaluation programs. Board development workshops, seminars, and other educational events that enhance skills as a board member. Handle information with discretion and confidentiality as necessary. Exercise authority as a board member only when acting in a meeting with the full board or as delegated by the board with members. Collaborate with members who serve this board and leave personal prejudices out of all board discussions. Represent Maya&rsquo;s Hope in a positive and supportive manner at all times. Display courteous conduct at all board and committee meetings. Refrain from intruding on administrative issues that are the responsibility of management, except to monitor the results of the organization. Monitor the financial condition of the organization. Understand and comply with the bylaws of Maya&rsquo;s Hope. Avoid conflicts of interest between my position as a board member and my personal or professional life (as referenced in Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s Conflict of Interest Policy.) If such a conflict does arise, I will disclose that conflict to the board and refrain from voting on matters in which I have conflict. Liability of Board Members As a fully incorporated non-profit, Maya&rsquo;s Hope enjoys the same limited liability that any corporation does. Corporations offer the protection of limited liability to corporate directors and officers. Limited liability means that the organization's directors and officers have limited personal liability for business debts. Generally, creditors can only go after corporate assets and insurance to satisfy liabilities incurred by the corporation. This principle applies, however, only when the board has fulfilled its basic duties, such as the duty of care. A board member is legally bound to exercise reasonable care when he or she makes a decision for the organization. Reasonable care is what an 'ordinarily prudent' person in a similar situation would do. Examples of when a board member may have personal liability include (but are not limited to) when a board member: personally and directly injures someone. personally guarantees a bank loan or a business debt on which the corporation defaults, or behaves in a fraudulent or illegal manner that causes harm, Maya&rsquo;s Hope maintains a Directors & Officers liability insurance policy. Responsibilities of Secretary: Meeting Minutes The primary task of the secretary of an executive board is to record and maintain the minutes of each board meeting. Meeting minutes are detail reports that highlight the predetermined agenda of each conference as well as what actually took place. For example, a secretary may notate the following: \\\"The meeting began at 11 a.m. The first order of business was for the president to discuss potential changes to the organization&rsquo;s mission statement; however, he was unable to attend the gathering due to medical reasons. The issue was put on hold until a later date.\\\" Record Maintenance As the custodian of corporate records, the secretary of an executive board must maintain all company files in a manner compliant with organizational policies as well as any laws that regulate the industry. These documents may include the firm&rsquo;s article of incorporation, bylaws and employee contact lists, as well as financial records. He must also develop and enforce policies regarding access to these confidential files. Security controls, such as who can access which files and what approvals are needed to do so, are examples of the many procedures he must implement. Depending on the industry in which the company does business, the secretary of the executive board may be required to file certain documents with the government. For example, a nonprofit organization must meet certain criteria to maintain its tax-exempt status. It is often the responsibility of the secretary to ensure that all necessary paperwork is completed and returned to the Internal Revenue Service. Organizational Representative It is not uncommon for the secretary of an executive board to serve as its signing officer. This designation gives her the authority to sign documents, such as contracts, checks and credit applications, on behalf of the organization. Because this responsibility wields so much power, many firms implement a system of checks and balances so it is not abused. For instance, before signing a service agreement, the secretary may need the express written permission of two other board members. She must follow these guidelines or risk termination and, in severe cases, criminal prosecution.", "title": "Board Member Opening at Maya's Hope", "zipcode": "10001", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D2862432%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "Maya's Hope"}, {"end": null, "description": "Inspire girls to explore the possibilities of technology!

A pioneering nonprofit, Heifer International, has shown that nonprofits can capture some of that money by making donations, given in a friend&rsquo;s name, feel like a present. It works! They raise $115 million a year this way. Imagine how much more gift money could be captured by nonprofits addressing popular causes, including your favorites. The challenge is that it is too daunting for most nonprofits to provide a gift-like experience: tangible donation opportunities, wish lists, gift registries, and personalized printed greeting cards. About www.ChangingThePresent.org Our nonprofit site provides a gift-like experience, which helps 400 leading nonprofits capture money normally spent on traditional presents. The NY Times called it an \\\"amazon.com of the nonprofit world.\\\" We are now about to invite all million nonprofits to join the site. We are also providing each with their own private, charitable gift sites so they can send supporters without exposing them to other nonprofits. See a sample: http://SampleNGO.GiftsForHumanity.org.

We offer four great benefits: Take on a leadership role Enhance your resume Make a difference Generate funds for college tuition and textbooks We are looking for passionate, energetic students with exceptional skills. This is an outstanding leadership opportunity in an innovative start-up nonprofit organization. About ClassWish ClassWish is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in NYC and working nationwide. Our initial focus was in providing resources for K-12 students. We are now turning attention to help generate funds for nonprofits and for college tuition and textbooks, as well. We offer high-achieving students unparalleled opportunities to assume responsibility, use their skills, gain experience, and make a difference--and provide relief from the cost of college tuition and textbooks. Here are the problems we are tackling: We are tackling two problems at once: Nonprofits need far more funding to fulfill their missions, and schools need far more resources for kids (books, computers, art supplies, musical instruments, science equipment, and sports equipment are all in desperately short supply). Students and their families are burdened by the skyrocketing cost of college tuition and textbooks. (By the way, be sure to see www.TuitionRevolution.org). Our Approach ClassWish is launching a new initiative to address these needs. Soon, students and their families will be able to earn an average of 8% of what they spend at stores, grocers, gas stations, restaurants, hotels, and airlines, and they will be able to direct that to their favorite schools, teachers, nonprofits, or even their own tuition and textbooks. What Campus Reps Will Do ClassWish Campus Reps will help raise awareness of this opportunity for students, professors, and their families to generate funding for schools, nonprofits, and college tuition. We will recruit a campus rep on each college campus. They, in turn, will recruit additional campus reps to focus on each of these areas: Greek life Residence halls Athletics Student government Student clubs and organizations Professors and administration Alumni Student media Social media Events Graphics Communications Marketing We Want to Hear From Outstanding Students Interested in becoming a Campus Rep?

FAQ - Review ClassWish.org&rsquo;s outstanding internship program here: Is this a business or a nonprofit? ClassWish is a nonprofit, but we use the latest techniques from the business world to make a leveraged, scalable and financially-self sustaining difference in the lives of tens of millions of children.

FAQ - Review ClassWish.org&rsquo;s outstanding internship program here: Is this a business or a nonprofit? ClassWish is a nonprofit, and we are working with Have to Have, an exciting new for-profit lifestyle website to make a big difference in the lives of tens of millions of children. This sounds ambitious! Daniel Burnham, the great Chicago architect, said \\\"Make no little plans; they have not the power to stir men&rsquo;s souls.\\\" (Nor women&rsquo;s, we hasten to add). Little plans also do not have the power to provide a better education to 56 million kids who deserve more than they are getting today. We face a crushing need in schools, have a solid plan to address it, and with your help, we intend to grow this very large and very fast. This sounds much better than the usual cookie dough sales from so many schools. ClassWish.org is the new solution for school fundraising so every teacher can get the classroom supplies (s)he needs. Where are you located? Right in Manhattan, across from Madison Square Garden, within one block of four express subway stops, PATH, LIRR, and NJ Transit. We will also hire interns to work remotely from other cities. What skills and experience are you looking for? We seek a wide range of skills: research, social media, outreach, and marketing. Tell us what you&rsquo;ve got. I looked at the two websites and have some suggestions. Great! This is a collaborative project, and we want to hear from you. Your ClassWish review and Have to Have review will be helpful. Is this a paid internship? We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your r\u00e9sum\u00e9, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions. When will you select the interns? We&rsquo;re agile. When we see a great candidate, we extend an invitation immediately. We won&rsquo;t keep you waiting for a decision. What dates will the internship run? We are hiring for the summer, for the fall semester, and beyond. Tell us what you are looking for. What are the hours? We welcome full-time and part-time interns. Let us know what works for you. What will I need to bring? Brains, heart, passion, energy, and passion. We also need you to bring your own notebook computer.

RSVP for our Information Session for Video Professionals! (See RSVP details below!) Our goal is to put together a volunteer team that can edit the groundbreaking work being done at The Actors Theatre Workshop. Using your professional skills to edit this wonderful material will surely stimulate hope, excitement and I believe bring true enlightenment to those who participate. At the same time you will reach another dimension in your craft as you learn about the unique filming/editing perspective of the ATW Founder and Artistic Director, Thurman E. Scott. ATW has long been on the front lines of disciplined creative training for theater professionals and individuals committed to fulfilling their creative potential. ATW has also been a safe haven for thousands of at-risk and homeless youth. The original theater and educational technique which has been tremendously successful with our professional acting students, has proven to be equally beneficial to the children we teach in our after-school programs. We have many years of footage from our adult acting workshop's and community program's that we want to share with you and the world. We've started sharing this video online and we've received such positive feedback from every corner of the globe that we are taking steps to put out more. This process takes time and so we would like to find more dedicated individuals who want to learn and make a difference in other people's lives and be a part of something hopeful by joining our video editing team. Our editors often talk about the beautiful, inspiring and deeply moving moments they have witnessed when a student actor or a child from a homeless shelter brings forth his talent and reaches for their potential. You literally see the moments when there is a shift in consciousness and they begin to accept their strength and the unique gifts that they have to offer the world. And in that moment you know that this person has changed forever-- and as a result undoubtedly so have you. By working directly with this material you will gain deep insight into the emotional and psychological breakdown of drama, and learn to see the penetrating insights that come out of script analysis, which gives you the ability to find and understand the eternal essence of ideas that are then formulated into a universal idea that helps to instill faith and spread hope to all individuals on a creative journey. So without further ado.. We invite you to a Volunteer Info Session for video editing professionals .To RSVP go to: http://www.actorstheatreworkshop.com, click on \\\"volunteers\\\" and fill out an online application. We will contact you to set up an Information and Interview Session.

This is an intensive Leadership Training Program in non-profit business management. Interns receive hands-on training as a management assistant. If skilled in video, interns may assist in video production and editing at our award-winning theater arts and community service organization. As video production becomes increasingly critical to the growth, development and success of managing a successful non-profit, we seek intern candidates that are leaders who are passionate about non-profit management and posses skills in video production and editing. Successful non-profits are built on powerful ideas that inspire hope. These ideas are manifested in the programs and the management of the organization. By gaining a working understanding of how to successfully manage a nonprofit organization, the intern begins to learn its core principals, which allows the intern to begin to take a leadership role in the organization. In addition, this knowledge is invaluable in the creation of videos that effectively promote and bring this work to the world. These videos are essential to the marketing and fund-raising efforts in any successful non-profit. We are looking for individuals with the ability to lead, manage teams, work independently, communicate effectively on the phone, in person and in writing and interact in a fast-paced business environment. We are looking for idealists and leaders who can put their thoughts and insights into action; positive, enthusiastic individuals who want to make a difference in the world and are committed to upholding the legacy and tradition of theater in the belief that theater can change a life and make the world a better place for everyone. The interns' primary responsibility is to manage the daily administrative operations of the organization and to take a leadership role in programming initiatives. There will be opportunities to work closely with the senior staff: in administrating over workshops for actors and community programs that serve Youth-at-Risk and homeless children. Under ATW supervision, interns will be accountable for projects in the management of ATW's studio rental business, administration, team management, marketing, development, sales, fund-raising, video production, event planning, and graphic design. For international applicants, English proficiency is required. In addition, Interns may also work on a combination of logging, editing, and production of on-going video projects that depend on ATW's current schedule and on the intern's skill level. Interns will work under the direction of a project manager. We seek applicants with training and experience logging footage, editing in Final Cut Pro, http streaming, digital shooting, lighting, sound and web design and development. Interns and Volunteers consistently report they gain tremendously from filming and reviewing footage of ATW classes and workshops and have benefited as if they had actually taken the classes themselves. In summary, we seek professional, detail-oriented individuals who are positive and curious, with a desire to learn and engage in a process. The Actors Theatre Workshop is an award-winning non-profit theater, educational institution and community center in NYC founded by award-winning actor, director, writer and producer, Thurman E.

It happens because you demand it to happen. As a RESULTS volunteer, you will learn how to be an effective advocate in the fight against poverty. Practically, that means: *Learning how to develop a relationship with your member of Congress so that when you get in touch, they listen. *Developing media skills so you can write punchy, persuasive opinion pieces and convince editorial boards to write about RESULTS issues. *Joining a movement of people committed to ending the systemic and structural injustices that drive poverty. *Meeting with your RESULTS group monthly for training, updates, and action. *Taking your message and skills straight to Capitol Hill.
