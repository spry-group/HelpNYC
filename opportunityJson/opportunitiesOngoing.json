For over a century, CMMB has worked to strengthen and support communities through healthcare programs and initiatives, the distribution of medicines and medical supplies, and the placement of volunteers. CMMB&rsquo;s Volunteer Program addresses the critical need for professionals in areas that lack sufficient resources for quality preventive and curative health services, especially for women and children. Our Volunteer Program has placed thousands of practitioners around the world to help develop and implement community health interventions, work at local hospitals and health facilities, conduct clinical training for host country counterparts, and deliver essential medicines and supplies. The ultimate goal of CMMB's Volunteer Program is to support our country teams and local healthcare workers by sending volunteers that are dedicated to strengthening local health systems and supporting a pattern of sustainable development. We believe in a world in which health and human dignity are shared by all. We believe that access to quality healthcare is a basic human right. For more than 100 years, we have worked with global partners to deliver locally sustainable, quality healthcare solutions to women, children, and their communities. We&rsquo;re ready to make it 100 more. We believe change starts with her. We work tirelessly for women&rsquo;s and children&rsquo;s health because they are disproportionately affected by illness and poverty. We know that healthy, educated, and empowered women are better able to raise healthy, educated, and confident children, and that communities depend on their livelihoods. We believe in people.

About ChangingThePresent.org The New York Times called ChangingThePresent.org an \\\"amazon.com of the nonprofit world\\\" for our work in helping 400 leading nonprofits capture money normally spent on traditional presents. At the same time that a million nonprofits desperately need more funds to accomplish their missions, Americans spend $450 billion a year on birthday, holiday, and other presents. Most of those presents are not very rewarding. Tons of sweaters, fuzzy slippers, and ties end up in the dark corners of our closets. More and more people, who seek meaning more than things, are starting to show their love by donating in a friend&rsquo;s name in lieu of giving traditional presents. The challenge for nonprofits is that it is simply too daunting to provide the requisite gift-like experience (tangible charitable gifts, wish lists and registries, and personalized printed greeting cards) that can make a donation feel like a rewarding gift. ChangingThePresent.org provides those tools to facilitate this type of giving for nonprofits and donors. We are about to take ChangingThePresent to the next level. That involves expanding from the initial 400 organizations to invite all 1.1 million nonprofits; adding additional causes and categories. Within each cause area, we will seek growth funding, invite advisors, recruit nonprofits, use media and social media to raise awareness among the public, and recruit celebrities to lend their voices.

About ChangingThePresent.org The New York Times called ChangingThePresent.org an \\\"amazon.com of the nonprofit world\\\" for our work in helping 400 leading nonprofits capture money normally spent on traditional presents. At the same time that a million nonprofits desperately need more funds to accomplish their missions, Americans spend $450 billion a year on birthday, holiday, and other presents. Most of those presents are not very rewarding. Tons of sweaters, fuzzy slippers, and ties end up in the dark corners of our closets. It is no surprise that a growing number of people, who seek meaning more than things, are starting to show their love by donating in a friend&rsquo;s name in lieu of giving traditional presents.

ChangingThePresent.org provides those tools to facilitate this type of giving for nonprofits and donors. We are about to take ChangingThePresent to the next level. That involves expanding from the initial 400 organizations to invite all 1.1 million nonprofits; adding additional causes and categories.

Help us build our team of people focused on any of charitable cause and on any of these fields: strategy, partnerships, finance, communications, social media, graphics, research, community management, fundraising, sponsorships, Public Relations (PR), Human Resources (HR), marketing, event management, organizing, and activism. For an overview of our program, please see www.ChangingThePresent-Join.org Do a Human Resource Internship with ChangingThePresent.org to Make a Difference! Use your skills, experience, knowledge, creativity and talent to improve the lives of millions. Help us capture for nonprofits - or other causes you care about -some of the $250 billion Americans spend each year buying presents. Become a member of our dynamic and creative international team, and become a leader among those who care for the same causes as you do. Help us grow a movement to facilitate and encourage a new type of meaningful giving through direct engagement of nonprofits, foundations, associations, thought leaders, media, and celebrities. Work from our Manhattan office or remotely. Enhance your resume and get a glowing letter of recommendation. About ChangingThePresent.org The New York Times called ChangingThePresent.org an \\\"amazon.com of the nonprofit world\\\" for our work in helping 400 leading nonprofits capture money normally spent on traditional presents. At the same time that a million nonprofits desperately need more funds to accomplish their missions, Americans spend $450 billion a year on birthday, holiday, and other presents. Most of those presents are not very rewarding. Tons of sweaters, fuzzy slippers, and ties end up in the dark corners of our closets. It is no surprise that a growing number of people, who seek meaning more than things, are starting to show their love by donating in a friend&rsquo;s name in lieu of giving traditional presents. The challenge for nonprofits is that it is simply too daunting to provide the requisite gift-like experience (tangible charitable gifts, wish lists and registries, and personalized printed greeting cards) that can make a donation feel like a rewarding gift. ChangingThePresent.org provides those tools to facilitate this type of giving for nonprofits and donors. We are about to take ChangingThePresent to the next level. That involves expanding from the initial 400 organizations to invite all 1.1 million nonprofits; adding additional causes and categories. Within each cause area, we will seek growth funding, invite advisors, recruit nonprofits, use media and social media to raise awareness among the public, and recruit celebrities to lend their voices. Imagine the impact we can make together as more and more people adopt this type of meaningful giving. Focus on Your Favorite Cause or Professional Field As well as HR, we also seek interns interested in each charitable cause and most professional fields, including strategy, partnerships, finance, communications, social media, graphics, research, community management, fundraising, sponsorships, Public Relations (PR), marketing, event management, organizing, and activism.

A pioneering nonprofit, Heifer International, has shown that nonprofits can capture some of that money by making donations, given in a friend&rsquo;s name, feel like a present. It works! They raise $115 million a year this way. Imagine how much more gift money could be captured by nonprofits addressing popular causes, including your favorites. The challenge is that it is too daunting for most nonprofits to provide a gift-like experience: tangible donation opportunities, wish lists, gift registries, and personalized printed greeting cards. About www.ChangingThePresent.org Our nonprofit site provides a gift-like experience, which helps 400 leading nonprofits capture money normally spent on traditional presents. The NY Times called it an \\\"amazon.com of the nonprofit world.\\\" We are now about to invite all million nonprofits to join the site.

The VNSNY Hospice Care volunteer&rsquo;s role is to be a supportive, caring person to the patient, their caregiver and family. Our goal is to provide comfort, care and choice to our patients and their families during this difficult time in their lives. Some of the ways that volunteers help includes visiting to ease social isolation, calling caregivers and families to offer emotional support, reading, listening to music, playing games, knitting, helping patients write memoirs and more. Volunteers with special skills, such as singing, massage or hairstyling are also needed. Bilingual Volunteers are also needed in all boroughs. VNSNY Hospice Care provides expert, compassionate care for individuals and families living with progressive, serious illness at the end of life. We are the resource of choice for hospice and palliative care information, education and service for every resident and health care provider in Metropolitan New York.

RSVP for our Information Session for Video Professionals! (See RSVP details below!) Our goal is to put together a volunteer team that can edit the groundbreaking work being done at The Actors Theatre Workshop. Using your professional skills to edit this wonderful material will surely stimulate hope, excitement and I believe bring true enlightenment to those who participate. At the same time you will reach another dimension in your craft as you learn about the unique filming/editing perspective of the ATW Founder and Artistic Director, Thurman E. Scott. ATW has long been on the front lines of disciplined creative training for theater professionals and individuals committed to fulfilling their creative potential. ATW has also been a safe haven for thousands of at-risk and homeless youth. The original theater and educational technique which has been tremendously successful with our professional acting students, has proven to be equally beneficial to the children we teach in our after-school programs. We have many years of footage from our adult acting workshop's and community program's that we want to share with you and the world. We've started sharing this video online and we've received such positive feedback from every corner of the globe that we are taking steps to put out more. This process takes time and so we would like to find more dedicated individuals who want to learn and make a difference in other people's lives and be a part of something hopeful by joining our video editing team. Our editors often talk about the beautiful, inspiring and deeply moving moments they have witnessed when a student actor or a child from a homeless shelter brings forth his talent and reaches for their potential. You literally see the moments when there is a shift in consciousness and they begin to accept their strength and the unique gifts that they have to offer the world. And in that moment you know that this person has changed forever-- and as a result undoubtedly so have you. By working directly with this material you will gain deep insight into the emotional and psychological breakdown of drama, and learn to see the penetrating insights that come out of script analysis, which gives you the ability to find and understand the eternal essence of ideas that are then formulated into a universal idea that helps to instill faith and spread hope to all individuals on a creative journey. So without further ado.. We invite you to a Volunteer Info Session for video editing professionals .To RSVP go to: http://www.actorstheatreworkshop.com, click on \\\"volunteers\\\" and fill out an online application. We will contact you to set up an Information and Interview Session.

This is an intensive Leadership Training Program in non-profit business management. Interns receive hands-on training as a management assistant. If skilled in video, interns may assist in video production and editing at our award-winning theater arts and community service organization. As video production becomes increasingly critical to the growth, development and success of managing a successful non-profit, we seek intern candidates that are leaders who are passionate about non-profit management and posses skills in video production and editing. Successful non-profits are built on powerful ideas that inspire hope. These ideas are manifested in the programs and the management of the organization. By gaining a working understanding of how to successfully manage a nonprofit organization, the intern begins to learn its core principals, which allows the intern to begin to take a leadership role in the organization. In addition, this knowledge is invaluable in the creation of videos that effectively promote and bring this work to the world. These videos are essential to the marketing and fund-raising efforts in any successful non-profit. We are looking for individuals with the ability to lead, manage teams, work independently, communicate effectively on the phone, in person and in writing and interact in a fast-paced business environment. We are looking for idealists and leaders who can put their thoughts and insights into action; positive, enthusiastic individuals who want to make a difference in the world and are committed to upholding the legacy and tradition of theater in the belief that theater can change a life and make the world a better place for everyone. The interns' primary responsibility is to manage the daily administrative operations of the organization and to take a leadership role in programming initiatives. There will be opportunities to work closely with the senior staff: in administrating over workshops for actors and community programs that serve Youth-at-Risk and homeless children. Under ATW supervision, interns will be accountable for projects in the management of ATW's studio rental business, administration, team management, marketing, development, sales, fund-raising, video production, event planning, and graphic design. For international applicants, English proficiency is required. In addition, Interns may also work on a combination of logging, editing, and production of on-going video projects that depend on ATW's current schedule and on the intern's skill level. Interns will work under the direction of a project manager. We seek applicants with training and experience logging footage, editing in Final Cut Pro, http streaming, digital shooting, lighting, sound and web design and development. Interns and Volunteers consistently report they gain tremendously from filming and reviewing footage of ATW classes and workshops and have benefited as if they had actually taken the classes themselves. In summary, we seek professional, detail-oriented individuals who are positive and curious, with a desire to learn and engage in a process. The Actors Theatre Workshop is an award-winning non-profit theater, educational institution and community center in NYC founded by award-winning actor, director, writer and producer, Thurman E. Scott, an acclaimed master teacher of acting and creative process with over 30 years of professional experience. Stella Adler declared, \\\" Thurman E.

BRC helps these neediest New Yorkers overcome the challenges of addiction, physical and mental illness, and poverty, and improves life in the community. Outreach is BRC's program for homeless individuals living on the streets and in other unstable situations. It is the most extensive outreach program in New York City covering specific Manhattan based locations, i.e. Grand Central Station, Penn Station and Port Authority Bus Terminal, 5 days per week in vans and on foot. Outreach staff and volunteers engages homeless individuals with the goal of assessing each individual's situation and needs and providing each client with an accessible doorway to services they need. Clients are afforded referral, transportation and placement at the resource deemed most beneficial to the individual, and each is treated with respect, professionalism and informed guidance. The Outreach Team encounters many individuals that are reluctant to use services or have found the available resources unmanageable and overwhelming. These clients are provided with counseling, information and advocacy in pursuing services, rights and resources. Every individual engaged is given the opportunity to access the services most suited to their needs. Working with Outreach staff, volunteers will help refer clients to assessment shelters, drop-in centers, drug and alcohol treatment, psychiatric and medical facilities, job training centers and entitlement offices. Normally a staff-only position, volunteers are needed to help us continue in our Outreach efforts. All teams will be midtown Manhattan based specifically at the Port Authority Bus Terminal on either Wednesday of Thursday evenings from 7pm to 9:30pm. This is the perfect opportunity for friends or co-workers who want to get involved together because teams will be comprised of a minimum of three individuals per shift, with a maximum of four each.

Volunteer Kenya / ICODEI is a non-religious, non-political volunteer organization run through a partnership of past overseas volunteers and local Kenyans. Our Microenterprise Development Program is our newest program. We have been active in helping set up small income-generating activities (IGA) for rural self-help groups since the early 2000's (primarily thru grants), but only recently began focusing our work on providing more advice, consulting assistance, and small loans to the groups. MDP volunteers work with the existing microenterprise groups to help them grow and improve their existing projects, as well as help newly forming groups start an IGA. The 5 main areas of volunteer activity in the MDP are as follows: \u2022 Progress Assessment \u2022 Facilitate a Group Project Discussion / Evaluation and Provide Project Advice \u2022 Facilitate Knowledge and Resource Sharing Within the Network of Groups \u2022 Provide Small Loans \u2022 Provide General Business Skills Training Seminars Most volunteers spend their time doing a combination of all the above 5 items. Our value-added is not just in the form of providing financial resources (loans) but includes project planning advice, basic management and accounting training, and (very importantly) volunteers act as facilitators between our vast network of groups in order to facilitate knowledge and resource sharing among the groups. Our pilot microlending program has just gotten off the ground during the last several months and we currently have about $10,000 USD in outstanding loans. The MDP volunteers will be spending a lot of their time over the next several months meeting with the loans groups to ensure that are on schedule with paying back their loans and that they are investing their money prudently (e.g., in productivity enhancing resources versus consumption items). As the loans are repaid, the volunteers then give them out in the form of new loans to other groups. We have a very large backlog of loan application requests. As a volunteer in the MDP you would spend the vast majority of your time out in the field meeting and working with the women microenterprise groups, which is a very rewarding and educational experience. All of the microenterprise groups within our network are independent groups. We do not manage their day to day operations and do not charge any type of fee for our services. We are a strict volunteer non-for-profit organization. All interest that we receive from the microloans goes towards new loans for additional groups. We are now have a network of around 100 microenterprise groups within the western Kenya region. As of June 2007, our organization has had over 350 volunteers since 1998 from over 6 different countries. Volunteers in our Microenterprise Development have come from a variety of backgrounds including undergrad business students (Duke, Rice, Miami, Indiana), MBA and graduate students on their summer break (Stanford, Penn, etc.), management consultants (BCG, McKinsey, CRA), retired professionals, and accountants.

The Way To Happiness is a non-denominational movement reversing the decline and restoring to man, his integrity and trust. Comprised of 21 principles, The Way To Happiness is a moral code based wholly on common sense. More than 70 million copies of The Way To Happiness booklet have been distributed in over 130 countries. Because it is non-religious in nature it can be used as a tool to re-introduce moral values into the Court system, without violating the codes and laws which separate Church and State. The Way To Happiness booklet educates readers worldwide with a non-religious code which guides one to a better quality of life, restoring and nourishing those qualities such as tolerance, respect and forgiveness, which have been revered through the centuries. These principles can be followed by anyone of any race color or creed. The Way To Happiness principles have been successfully used to help improve family relations, increase tolerance in the workplace and even in the prison system which has noted a remarkable drop in the recidivism of offenders who have completed the program. The principles work to restore the bonds that unite mankind. For more information you may visit the foundation's website www.thewaytohappiness.org. For reservations or questions please contact Evelyn Garcia at 786-873-7718. I look forward to meeting with you and assisting you to guide people towards real solutions to their problems. Description The Way To Happiness: Because your survival is important to me. Happiness: N. A condition or state of well being, contentment, pleasure, joyful, untroubled existence, the reaction to having nice things happen to one. If one does not survive, no joy and no happiness are obtainable. Trying to survive in a chaotic (1) ,dishonest and generally immoral (2) society is difficult. Any individual seeks to obtain from life what pleasure and freedom from pain that they can. Your own survival can be threatened by the bad actions of others around you. Your own happiness can be turned to tragedy and sorrow by the dishonesty and misconduct of others. I am sure you can think of this actually happening. Such wrongs reduce one's survival and impair one's happiness. You are important to other people. You are listened to. You can influence others. The happiness or unhappiness of others you could name is important to you. Without too much trouble, using this book, you can help them survive and lead happier lives. While no one can guarantee that anyone else can be happy, their chances of survival and happiness can be improved. And with theirs, yours will be. It is in your power to point the way to a less dangerous and happier life. (1) Chaotic: having the character or nature of total disorder or confusion. (2) Immoral: Not moral; not following good practices of behavior; not doing right; lacking any idea of proper conduct. 1. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. 1-1 Get care when you are ill. 1-2 Keep your body clean. 1-3 Preserve your teeth. 1-4 Eat properly. 1-5 Get rest. 2. BE TEMPERATE 2-1 Do not do harmful drugs. 2-2 Do not take alcohol to excess. 3 DON'T BE PROMISCUOUS. (promiscuous: casual random sexual relations). 3-1 Be faithful to your sexual partner. 4. LOVE AND HELP CHILDREN. 5. HONOR AND HELP YOUR PARENTS. (Honor: to show respect for; to treat with deference and courtesy). 6. SET A GOOD EXAMPLE. 7. SEEK TO LIVE WITH THE TRUTH. 7-1 Do not tell harmful lies. 7-2 Do not bear false witness. 8. DO NOT MURDER. 9. DON'T DO ANYTHING ILLEGAL. 10. SUPPORT A GOVERNMENT DESIGNED AND RUN FOR ALL THE PEOPLE. 11. DO NOT HARM A PERSON OF GOODWILL. 12. SAFEGAURD AND IMPROVE YOUR ENVIRONMENT. 12-1 Be of good appearance. 12-2 Take care of your own area. 12-3 Help take care of the planet. 13. DO NOT STEAL. 14. BE WORTHY OF TRUST. 14-1 keep your word once given. 15. FUFILL YOUR OBLIGATIONS. 16. BE INDUSTRIOUS. (INDUSTRIOUS: applying oneself with energy to study or work; actively and purposely getting things done; opposite of being idle and accomplishing nothing. 17. BE COMPETENT 17-1 Look. See what you see, not what someone tells you that you see. 17-2 Learn. 17-3 Practice. 18 RESPECT THE RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OF OTHERS. 19 TRY NOT TO DO THINGS TO OTHERS THAT YOU WOULD NOT LIKE THEM TO DO TO YOU. 20. TRY TO TREAT OTHERS AS YOU WOULD WANT THEM TO TREAT YOU. Now what do you suppose would happen if one were to try to treat those around him with: Justness, loyalty, good sportsmanship, fairness, honesty, kindness, consideration, compassion, self-control, tolerance, forgiveness, benevolence, belief, respect, politeness, dignity, admiration, friendliness, love... and did it with integrity? 21.

Sprout is a non-profit organization based in New York City focused on providing innovative programs for adults with developmental disabilities.With our network of resources and dedicated volunteers, which we call leaders, Sprout opens up fascinating new worlds to people with disabilities. Sprout's Overnight Vacations Program is looking for individuals who have the energy, motivation and desire to work with adults with developmental disabilities. What do Sprout leaders do? Sprout leaders' primary goal is to give adults with developmental disabilities the opportunity to experience and enjoy recreational, educational and leisure activities through overnight vacations. Leaders are responsible for the overall safety and enjoyment of their group, 24 hours a day, while on a Sprout trip. Duties include safety monitoring, personal hygiene assistance, providing physical and emotional support, activity planning, budgeting, logistics, and enhancing fun. The work is hard yet immensely rewarding as you develop leadership skills and gain insight into your own abilities. What type of training is provided? Leaders must complete a pre-service training, which provides the necessary procedures and tools to run a successful and enjoyable vacation. Leaders who are drivers receive extra training on how to safely drive our 15-passenger vans. In addition, all leaders receive a copy of Sprout's Leadership Handbook to help with policies and guidelines. What is the time commitment? Sprout vacations last 3 - 7 days depending on the time of year and destination of the trip. When a leader is selected for an overnight vacation, Sprout asks that the leader dedicate themselves to stay with their group throughout the entire duration of the vacation. Some leaders only choose to lead one trip a year while others spend several months with us leading up to 8 trips or more. Sprout strives to make our program flexible for our leaders based on the amount of time leaders can give. Do leaders have any free or personal time while on a trip? Sprout trips are working vacations for the leaders who choose to participate. Because Sprout leaders are responsible for their group 24 hours a day, there is no free or personal time allotted. In order to give our participants the opportunity to experience and enjoy a vacation, Sprout leaders must be available at all times to provide the support any one participant may need. What type of trips can Sprout leaders expect to join? A majority of Sprout trips take place within a day's drive of New York City. Destinations include Atlantic City, Amish Country, Boston, Lake George, Cleveland, Maine and Virginia Beach. Exotic trips like cruises, Hawaii, and Europe are presented to leaders who have demonstrated high levels of commitment, service hours and have gained positive feedback from participants and Sprout office staff. Are there any special skills or requirements? No special background or education is required to become a Sprout leader. We encourage people from all cultures and professions, and of all ethnic and educational backgrounds. Once accepted into the program, you will receive the necessary tools to sign up for outings and how to assist our participants. Requirements include: -21+ years old -Provide references -Participate in training session -Willingness to complete necessary background checks -Evaluate participants' behavior -Fluent English -Willing to drive a 15 passenger van -Love to travel & have fun!

FFL also helps underserved communities of schools form their own networks of external support that form partnerships, raise funds and engage volunteers who are committed to increasing student engagement with writing. FFL seeks volunteer Board members to help carry out this mission. Fifteen years ago, the Advisory Board of the Bronx Academy of Letters (a new public high school funded with Gates Foundation funds) was formed to provide educational resources and enrichment opportunities to one small school in the Bronx, NY. The vision of the Board was that in urban public schools, where resources were limited, external support for literacy education could provide improved academic performance, increased college readiness and better global citizenship among students. The Board supported and implemented programs at the Bronx Academy of Letters that stressed increased fluency in communication, through immersion with the \\\"word\\\" - written, spoken and performed. After more than a decade of experience serving as the primary external support organization for Bronx Letters, the Advisory Board incorporated in 2012 and formed FFL, which continued its support of Bronx Letters, until August 2014, when it expanded the reach of its work beyond a single school. In 2017, FFL is working to provide urban schools with a blueprint for how to positively impact their communities through external support for literacy-based academic and enrichment programs.

Curriculum is provided by the Wa-Shokuiku Project. Supervise children participants, ensuring proper hygiene, meal creation, and clean up. Facilitate class discussions of concepts of Japanese cuisine and food education, allowing participants to brainstorm how they might put new knowledge and food education concepts into action, discuss barriers to adopting new concepts, and share ideas with their peers.

Each week there are hundreds of animal rescue transports taking place where animals are moved from high-kill shelters to no-kill shelters and rescue organizations, as well as foster homes and adopters. It's easy for you to get involved and help save more animals simply by driving a leg in this relay. How it works: 1. Sign-up on Doobert.com or use the Facebook plug-in (search for \\\" Doobert Rescue\\\" on Facebook) and specify the days you're available, the distance you're willing to drive, and then sit back and we'll do the rest. 2. When an animal rescue organization posts a transport request, the system will automatically search to see if it matches your profile (if you're available and within the distance) and then it automatically sends you an e-mail. 3. Then you simply click on the leg that you can cover and everyone else will see that you've signed up for that leg. 4. You'll get communications from the transport coordinator and, once the transport is a \\\"go\\\", you simply drive to the meeting place, load up the animals, and drive them to the next meeting place to hand them off to the next volunteer. You'll get plenty of doggy kisses and thank you's along the way as the animals know you are there to help them.

Graphic Design Internship at ClassWish.org! Work in NYC or Virtually We are recruiting outstanding graphic design students as interns for late Summer 2012 and the 2012-2013 school year (either or both!) to collaborate on the boldest nonprofit initiative we know. We are looking for passionate, energetic students with exceptional skills to create web page layouts, flyers, logos, etc. for ClassWish.org. This is an outstanding leadership opportunity in an innovative start-up nonprofit organization. Here is the problem we are tackling: K-12 schools in this country do not have enough resources to let children explore their potential and excel. Art supplies, books, computers, musical instruments, science equipment, sports equipment, and even paper for computers and printers are all in desperately short supply. Our Approach: ClassWish . org, an exciting new nonprofit, uses modern business practices and the latest marketing techniques to help 125,000 schools serving 56 million kids, inform, inspire and engage supporters. Teachers visit the site to create Wish Lists of the resources they need. People in the community can see exactly what is needed and contribute to help. About Us: The people behind ClassWish.org include such prominent education and business leaders as Adam Hirsch, former COO, Mashable; Laurie Coots, CMO, TBWA; Scott Cutler, EVP, New York Stock Exchange; Betsy Morgan, former CEO, Huffington Post; Nancy Pelz-Paget, Director, Education and Society Program, Aspen Institute; Sharon Robinson, CEO, American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education. Forbes Magazine liked our approach so much that they donated a full page to help raise awareness. Yo-Yo Ma, Tony Hawk and Dwight Howard are among the celebrities who have offered to help promote ClassWish.org. The work: Teachers and students are already getting supplies from ClassWish.org. Now, we need to develop attention-grabbing graphics so we can help more kids. You will take a leadership role and work with other highly motivated interns, established professionals, and directly with our co-founder. What do we offer? You will enhance your portfolio with projects that will be displayed on the Internet as well as in print, visible to potential future employers, and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you have helped children get the tools they need to perform at their best. If you want to gain great experience and do something you will always be proud of, send a cover letter and a resume to interns @ ClassWish . org. Impress us. This is competitive. FAQ Is this a business or a nonprofit? ClassWish is a nonprofit, but we use the latest techniques from the business world to make a leveraged, scalable and financially-self sustaining difference in the lives of tens of millions of children. This sounds ambitious! Daniel Burnham, the great Chicago architect, said \\\"Make no little plans; they have not the power to stir men&rsquo;s souls.\\\" (Nor women&rsquo;s, we hasten to add). Little plans also do not have the power to provide a better education to 56 million kids who deserve more than they are getting today. We face a crushing need in schools, have a solid plan to address it, and with your help, we intend to grow this very large and very fast. Where are you located? We are in Manhattan, conveniently located right across from Madison Square Garden. There are four express subway stops within one block. We will also hire interns to work remotely from other cities. I looked at your site and have some suggestions. Great! This is a collaborative project, and we want to hear from you. Is this a paid internship? We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your portfolio, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions. When will you select the interns? We&rsquo;re agile. When we see a great candidate, we extend an invitation immediately. We won&rsquo;t keep you waiting for a decision. What dates will the internship run? We are hiring for the spring semester, for the summer, and beyond. Tell us what you are looking for. What are the hours? We welcome full-time and part-time interns. Let us know what works for you. What will I need to bring?

Volunteer Kenya - ICODEI is a non-religious, non-political volunteer organization run through a partnership of past overseas volunteers and local Kenyans. Our Microenterprise Development Program is our newest program. We have been active in helping set up small income-generating activities (IGA) for rural self-help groups since the early 2000's (primarily thru grants), but only recently began focusing our work on providing more advice, consulting assistance, and small loans to the groups. MDP volunteers work with the existing microenterprise groups to help them grow and improve their existing projects, as well as help newly forming groups start an IGA. The 5 main areas of volunteer activity in the MDP are as follows: \u2022 Progress Assessment \u2022 Facilitate a Group Project Discussion / Evaluation and Provide Project Advice \u2022 Facilitate Knowledge and Resource Sharing Within the Network of Groups \u2022 Provide Small Loans \u2022 Provide General Business Skills Training Seminars Most volunteers spend their time doing a combination of all the above 5 items. Our value-added is not just in the form of providing financial resources (loans) but includes project planning advice, basic management and accounting training, and (very importantly) volunteers act as facilitators between our vast network of groups in order to facilitate knowledge and resource sharing among the groups. Our pilot microlending program has just gotten off the ground during the last several months and we currently have about $10,000 USD in outstanding loans. The MDP volunteers will be spending a lot of their time over the next several months meeting with the loans groups to ensure that are on schedule with paying back their loans and that they are investing their money prudently (e.g., in productivity enhancing resources versus consumption items). As the loans are repaid, the volunteers then give them out in the form of new loans to other groups. We have a very large backlog of loan application requests. As a volunteer in the MDP you would spend the vast majority of your time out in the field meeting and working with the women microenterprise groups, which is a very rewarding and educational experience. All of the microenterprise groups within our network are independent groups. We do not manage their day to day operations and do not charge any type of fee for our services. We are a strict volunteer non-for-profit organization. All interest that we receive from the microloans goes towards new loans for additional groups. We are now have a network of around 100 microenterprise groups within the western Kenya region. As of June 2007, our organization has had over 350 volunteers since 1998 from over 6 different countries. Volunteers in our Microenterprise Development have come from a variety of backgrounds including undergrad business students (Duke, Rice, Miami, Indiana), MBA and graduate students on their summer break (Stanford, Penn, etc.), management consultants (BCG, McKinsey, CRA), retired professionals, and accountants.

The Oxfam Action Corps aimed to right the wrongs of poverty, hunger, and injustice. Oxfam Action Corps embodied the campaigns and efforts of Oxfam America&rsquo;s work. Our volunteer organizers across the United States have lobbied our elected officials in nationwide efforts, campaigned in our communities for international food companies to improve their policies, an ... d canvassed to educate and empower. Hundreds of lobby visits were conducted, tens of thousands of signatures were collected, and over twenty campaigns were championed, all culminating in an unstoppable momentum of people power. Equally important are the relationships fostered through our efforts. As we grew our networks, we strengthened our forces to mobilize for human rights. Recently Oxfam announced that in response to changing global realities, Oxfam is restructuring internationally, which means the end of the official Oxfam Action Corps program; however, we the volunteers and grassroots organizers choose to continue and expand upon our work under a new a banner: Action Corps. We choose to persevere and continue our mission. As we embark on this new chapter, we commit to creating positive change in our world and believe we can end poverty in our lifetime regardless of the challenges we may face.
