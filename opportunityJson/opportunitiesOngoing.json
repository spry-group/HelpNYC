Docents are needed every day of the week, especially Friday and Saturday. They provide schoolchildren and unscheduled visitors with tours of the museum exhibit. Because the Holocaust and Tolerance Center is a small institution with irregular visitor flow, docents and educators are asked, in addition to giving tours, to provide visitors with information, check them in, monitor the book shop, and help with other duties as assigned. Special Events - the Center hosts special events and programs throughout the year. We need assistance with set-up, clean-up, registration, logistics, and greeting. This position is a perfect fit for people who are friendly and outgoing, can multi-task, and who want to help, but don&rsquo;t have a lot of time. Most special events take place evenings or weekends. Adopt a Project - the Center has a wide array of projects from outreach to grant-writing just waiting for someone with initiative, creative thinking, and phone and people skills to move it along.

Citizen Schools is an education nonprofit that partners with public middle schools in underserved New York City communities to expand the learning day. We do this by providing hands-on and relevant lessons for students they may not experience during regular school hours. What is Citizen Schools&rsquo; mission? Our mission is to engage young people with real-world opportunities in their learning experience and make sure they are supported and motivated to succeed. How does Citizen Schools work? We bring volunteer professionals into the classroom to teach their knowledge and expertise through project-based apprenticeships. When students are able to learn from authentic professionals, like you, they can start to make connections between what they are learning in school and the real world. How do apprenticeships work? Apprenticeships are 10 week volunteer-led classes that take place once a week from 4:15-5:40pm. The final student showcase at the end of the apprenticeship, called the \\\"WOW!,\\\" allows students the opportunity to share what they've learned and accomplished throughout the semester. What type of support do volunteers receive? Each volunteer is supported by a Citizen Schools co-teacher who works with you to develop and facilitate the lessons. We also offer two trainings at the beginning of the semester and debriefing sessions each week after your apprenticeship.", "title": "Volunteer Teaching Opportunity in New York (NYC, Brooklyn, or Bronx)", "zipcode": "10451", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D2132920%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "Citizen Schools New York"}, {"end": null, "description": "Overview: SBU College Prep Mentors provide program youth with the tools necessary to graduate high school and attend college.

Each week there are hundreds of animal rescue transports taking place where animals are moved from high-kill shelters to no-kill shelters and rescue organizations, as well as foster homes and adopters. It's easy for you to get involved and help save more animals simply by driving a leg in this relay. How it works: 1. Sign-up on Doobert.com or use the Facebook plug-in (search for \\\" Doobert Rescue\\\" on Facebook) and specify the days you're available, the distance you're willing to drive, and then sit back and we'll do the rest. 2. When an animal rescue organization posts a transport request, the system will automatically search to see if it matches your profile (if you're available and within the distance) and then it automatically sends you an e-mail. 3. Then you simply click on the leg that you can cover and everyone else will see that you've signed up for that leg. 4. You'll get communications from the transport coordinator and, once the transport is a \\\"go\\\", you simply drive to the meeting place, load up the animals, and drive them to the next meeting place to hand them off to the next volunteer. You'll get plenty of doggy kisses and thank you's along the way as the animals know you are there to help them.

You get to pick the type, duration and tell potential shelters and rescues about your situation. It&rsquo;s up to you what information you share. 2.

They can see the information you&rsquo;ve shared and reach out to you if there is a match. 3.

Sprout is a non-profit organization based in New York City focused on providing innovative programs for adults with developmental disabilities.With our network of resources and dedicated volunteers, which we call leaders, Sprout opens up fascinating new worlds to people with disabilities. Sprout's Overnight Vacations Program is looking for individuals who have the energy, motivation and desire to work with adults with developmental disabilities. What do Sprout leaders do? Sprout leaders' primary goal is to give adults with developmental disabilities the opportunity to experience and enjoy recreational, educational and leisure activities through overnight vacations. Leaders are responsible for the overall safety and enjoyment of their group, 24 hours a day, while on a Sprout trip. Duties include safety monitoring, personal hygiene assistance, providing physical and emotional support, activity planning, budgeting, logistics, and enhancing fun. The work is hard yet immensely rewarding as you develop leadership skills and gain insight into your own abilities. What type of training is provided? Leaders must complete a pre-service training, which provides the necessary procedures and tools to run a successful and enjoyable vacation. Leaders who are drivers receive extra training on how to safely drive our 15-passenger vans. In addition, all leaders receive a copy of Sprout's Leadership Handbook to help with policies and guidelines. What is the time commitment? Sprout vacations last 3 - 7 days depending on the time of year and destination of the trip. When a leader is selected for an overnight vacation, Sprout asks that the leader dedicate themselves to stay with their group throughout the entire duration of the vacation. Some leaders only choose to lead one trip a year while others spend several months with us leading up to 8 trips or more. Sprout strives to make our program flexible for our leaders based on the amount of time leaders can give. Do leaders have any free or personal time while on a trip? Sprout trips are working vacations for the leaders who choose to participate. Because Sprout leaders are responsible for their group 24 hours a day, there is no free or personal time allotted. In order to give our participants the opportunity to experience and enjoy a vacation, Sprout leaders must be available at all times to provide the support any one participant may need. What type of trips can Sprout leaders expect to join? A majority of Sprout trips take place within a day's drive of New York City. Destinations include Atlantic City, Amish Country, Boston, Lake George, Cleveland, Maine and Virginia Beach. Exotic trips like cruises, Hawaii, and Europe are presented to leaders who have demonstrated high levels of commitment, service hours and have gained positive feedback from participants and Sprout office staff. Are there any special skills or requirements? No special background or education is required to become a Sprout leader. We encourage people from all cultures and professions, and of all ethnic and educational backgrounds. Once accepted into the program, you will receive the necessary tools to sign up for outings and how to assist our participants. Requirements include: -21+ years old -Provide references -Participate in training session -Willingness to complete necessary background checks -Evaluate participants' behavior -Fluent English -Willing to drive a 15 passenger van -Love to travel & have fun!

Each week there are hundreds of animal rescue transports taking place where animals are moved from high-kill shelters to no-kill shelters and rescue organizations, as well as foster homes and adopters. It's easy for you to get involved and help save more animals simply by driving a leg in this relay. How it works: 1. Sign-up on Doobert.com or use the Facebook plug-in (search for \\\" Doobert Rescue\\\" on Facebook) and specify the days you're available, the distance you're willing to drive, and then sit back and we'll do the rest. 2. When an animal rescue organization posts a transport request, the system will automatically search to see if it matches your profile (if you're available and within the distance) and then it automatically sends you an e-mail. 3. Then you simply click on the leg that you can cover and everyone else will see that you've signed up for that leg. 4. You'll get communications from the transport coordinator and, once the transport is a \\\"go\\\", you simply drive to the meeting place, load up the animals, and drive them to the next meeting place to hand them off to the next volunteer. You'll get plenty of doggy kisses and thank you's along the way as the animals know you are there to help them.

Hospice volunteers enhance the quality of life and help reduce the burden for family caregivers by providing support, assistance, in patient&rsquo;s homes, in nursing homes, and assisted living facilities. To be a volunteer, there is no special requirement other than a sincere desire to help people and the ability to listen.

Hospice volunteers can commit to as little or as much time as they wish. Some volunteers provide several hours of service each week while others commit to a few hours each month. Serving as valued members of the hospice team, for just a few hours of your time you can make a significant impact on the lives of patients and their loved ones.

We are currently looking for two embedded tutors to support two sections of this course. This is a great opportunity for a student studying science education or interested in tutoring science. In this role, you would work collaboratively with an instructor to improve students&rsquo; performance, while being supported and guided by an experienced academic support professional. As a tutor for the biology course in College Now, you would commit to three hours on Saturday, broken down as the last two hours of the 9-1:20PM course with the possibility of an extra hour after class. You would identify and support students who are struggling, participate during the lecture to support the class on the whole, and provide feedback to the instructor regarding students' concerns and difficulties that can lead to changes in future lessons. You might also design assignments, identify/track students who are struggling and create for them differentiated instruction. CT's embedded tutoring program has been successful in helping students gain access to support that they otherwise could not receive given their limited availability to be on campus Saturdays. Having a tutor in the class early in the semester will allow us to push to reduce withdrawals and student failure rates. Your work would not only help the class, but help us improve this model so that we can expand it across all the courses within College Now, and across departments where appropriate as well. To apply, you must: have received an A- or A in introduction to biology have a GPA at or above 3.2, or have completed a degree in biology/other natural sciences submit biweekly reports, and meet through Google Hangout/in person with the director on a biweekly basis. be willing to complete 10 hours of College Reading and Learning Aligned (CRLA) training.

Volunteers are there to introduce the literacy experience while the pediatrician then reinforces the importance of reading by giving each child a brand, new book we provide.

These trainings will consist of videos, interactive activities, and conversations that lead to defined targets and outcomes, including completing a capstone project. Facilitate 5+ modules, an average of once per week lasting up to 90 minutes each. Clearly articulate concepts related to 21st century skills building such as communication, leadership and program management. Enter data into our client management database regarding Service Scholar participation after each session. What is the average time commitment for a Skills Trainer? A Skills Trainer will facilitate 90 minutes each week to a group of Service Scholars over the duration of a cohort, typically an 8-12 week commitment. However, you can commit to a longer or shorter window of time, to meet your needs. What is ServiceWorks? ServiceWorks - powered by AmeriCorps, the Citi Foundation, and Points of Light - is a groundbreaking, national program that uses volunteer service as a strategy to help 25,000 low-income young adults in 10 U.S. cities develop the skills they need to prepare for college and careers. We share the belief that civic engagement and service leadership can be a pathway to success. ServiceWorks will demonstrate that service can be an effective strategy to level the playing field for underserved young people, not only by decreasing the opportunity gaps they face but by increasing the likelihood that they will stay in school and find good jobs.

ServiceWorks is a groundbreaking national program that utilizes volunteerism, Skills Training and Success Coaching to increase the chances of opportunity youth 16-24 getting into college and finding employment. You may find out more about it here: http://www.jerseycares.org/serviceworks. Success Coaches are mentors and accountability partners. They help set SMART goals and teach resume writing, LinkedIn and other skills to their Service Scholars. The Coaches meet with their Scholars at a location of their choice in Newark but most often the lion's share of the meetings are done remotely via Skype, conference call, group chat etc. A Success Coach may get into Newark for 2 or 3 of 10 meetings but reaching the Scholars is often a remote activity due to their schedules. If you are looking for the opportunity to spend about three hours a week (with 2 to 3 Scholars) to make a difference in the lives of a few young adults, then this is a great opportunity for you.

Graphic Design Internship at ClassWish.org! Work in NYC or Virtually We are recruiting outstanding graphic design students as interns for late Summer 2012 and the 2012-2013 school year (either or both!) to collaborate on the boldest nonprofit initiative we know. We are looking for passionate, energetic students with exceptional skills to create web page layouts, flyers, logos, etc. for ClassWish.org. This is an outstanding leadership opportunity in an innovative start-up nonprofit organization. Here is the problem we are tackling: K-12 schools in this country do not have enough resources to let children explore their potential and excel. Art supplies, books, computers, musical instruments, science equipment, sports equipment, and even paper for computers and printers are all in desperately short supply. Our Approach: ClassWish . org, an exciting new nonprofit, uses modern business practices and the latest marketing techniques to help 125,000 schools serving 56 million kids, inform, inspire and engage supporters. Teachers visit the site to create Wish Lists of the resources they need. People in the community can see exactly what is needed and contribute to help. About Us: The people behind ClassWish.org include such prominent education and business leaders as Adam Hirsch, former COO, Mashable; Laurie Coots, CMO, TBWA; Scott Cutler, EVP, New York Stock Exchange; Betsy Morgan, former CEO, Huffington Post; Nancy Pelz-Paget, Director, Education and Society Program, Aspen Institute; Sharon Robinson, CEO, American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education. Forbes Magazine liked our approach so much that they donated a full page to help raise awareness. Yo-Yo Ma, Tony Hawk and Dwight Howard are among the celebrities who have offered to help promote ClassWish.org. The work: Teachers and students are already getting supplies from ClassWish.org. Now, we need to develop attention-grabbing graphics so we can help more kids. You will take a leadership role and work with other highly motivated interns, established professionals, and directly with our co-founder. What do we offer? You will enhance your portfolio with projects that will be displayed on the Internet as well as in print, visible to potential future employers, and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you have helped children get the tools they need to perform at their best. If you want to gain great experience and do something you will always be proud of, send a cover letter and a resume to interns @ ClassWish . org. Impress us. This is competitive. FAQ Is this a business or a nonprofit? ClassWish is a nonprofit, but we use the latest techniques from the business world to make a leveraged, scalable and financially-self sustaining difference in the lives of tens of millions of children. This sounds ambitious! Daniel Burnham, the great Chicago architect, said \\\"Make no little plans; they have not the power to stir men&rsquo;s souls.\\\" (Nor women&rsquo;s, we hasten to add). Little plans also do not have the power to provide a better education to 56 million kids who deserve more than they are getting today. We face a crushing need in schools, have a solid plan to address it, and with your help, we intend to grow this very large and very fast. Where are you located? We are in Manhattan, conveniently located right across from Madison Square Garden. There are four express subway stops within one block. We will also hire interns to work remotely from other cities. I looked at your site and have some suggestions. Great! This is a collaborative project, and we want to hear from you. Is this a paid internship? We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your portfolio, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions. When will you select the interns? We&rsquo;re agile. When we see a great candidate, we extend an invitation immediately. We won&rsquo;t keep you waiting for a decision. What dates will the internship run? We are hiring for the spring semester, for the summer, and beyond. Tell us what you are looking for. What are the hours? We welcome full-time and part-time interns. Let us know what works for you. What will I need to bring? Brains, heart, passion, energy, a notebook computer, and a passion to make an immediate improvement to the education of tens of millions of children. Sounds exciting! How can I apply?

Hundreds of lobby visits were conducted, tens of thousands of signatures were collected, and over twenty campaigns were championed, all culminating in an unstoppable momentum of people power. Equally important are the relationships fostered through our efforts. As we grew our networks, we strengthened our forces to mobilize for human rights. Recently Oxfam announced that in response to changing global realities, Oxfam is restructuring internationally, which means the end of the official Oxfam Action Corps program; however, we the volunteers and grassroots organizers choose to continue and expand upon our work under a new a banner: Action Corps.

Four-month-old Bosley is a puppy with a special mission. One day, he will provide enhanced independence and mobility to a person with disabilities - whether they're blind or visually impaired, or have a disability other than blindness. But Bosley isn't growing up at the Guide Dog Foundation for the Blind. Each year, the Guide Dog Foundation breeds about 300 exceptional puppies, and it's vital that Bosley and other pups like him spend the first year of their lives with surrounded by the love and security of volunteer foster families called puppy walkers. Puppy walkers help Foundation puppies grow up to be confident dogs. What's involved in raising a Guide Dog Foundation puppy? Bosley went to live with his puppy walkers when he was about nine weeks old. He's learning basic obedience and social skills while being exposed to many different situations. People who raise Guide Dog Foundation puppies say it is the most rewarding thing they've ever done. Puppy raisers come from everywhere - stay-at-home moms or dads, teachers, college students, retirees, people with flexible work environments - and are crucial members of the Guide Dog Foundation family. By opening their hearts and homes to a puppy, a puppy raiser plays a crucial role in helping a person with disabilities live an independent life. Every puppy walker family works with a Guide Dog Foundation puppy adviser, who is available to answer questions and offer guidance and support. When he is about 14 months old, Bosley will return to the Guide Dog Foundation's Smithtown campus to begin his training as a guide or service dog. Puppy raisers will admit it's tough to say good-bye, but when they see the pup they raised take its place at the side of someone with disabilities, the ache they feel turns pride. There are puppies waiting now to join your loving home for a chance to start their careers.

Beginning Nov 19, 2010, the Love Yourself team took to the streets and subways of New York City greeting people with messages of kindness and love, distributing over 500 \\\"Love Yourself\\\" stickers and hand-folded hearts, and encouraged people to engage in a conversation about self-love. Since then, similar events have been held in Pakistan, Paris, Luxembourg, West Africa, Florida, Netherlands, Massachusetts, Australia, Iceland, England and Stockholm. We currently have distributed over 750,000 stickers. In 2011, the Project began working with children at The Earth School in NYC. Team members helped youngsters (ages 5-12) make origami hearts and facilitated discussions about what it means to 'love yourself&rsquo;. The origami hearts were featured in the \\\"1,000 Hearts\\\"Exhibition. To create the \\\"1,000 Hearts\\\"exhibition, the team collected 1,000 hand-folded origami hearts from people all around the world. Participants shared something they love about themselves and folded the paper into a heart shape. The hearts and messages were presented both visually and aurally. Messages from the hearts are continuously being posted via Twitter. We just celebrated our 5th year anniversary at BAM FISHER 2015 with 5,000 hearts of self love messages.

We offer four great benefits: Take on a leadership role Enhance your resume Make a difference Generate funds for college tuition and textbooks We are looking for passionate, energetic students with exceptional skills. This is an outstanding leadership opportunity in an innovative start-up nonprofit organization. About ClassWish ClassWish is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in NYC and working nationwide. Our initial focus was in providing resources for K-12 students. We are now turning attention to help generate funds for nonprofits and for college tuition and textbooks, as well. We offer high-achieving students unparalleled opportunities to assume responsibility, use their skills, gain experience, and make a difference--and provide relief from the cost of college tuition and textbooks. Here are the problems we are tackling: We are tackling two problems at once: Nonprofits need far more funding to fulfill their missions, and schools need far more resources for kids (books, computers, art supplies, musical instruments, science equipment, and sports equipment are all in desperately short supply). Students and their families are burdened by the skyrocketing cost of college tuition and textbooks. (By the way, be sure to see www.TuitionRevolution.org). Our Approach ClassWish is launching a new initiative to address these needs. Soon, students and their families will be able to earn an average of 8% of what they spend at stores, grocers, gas stations, restaurants, hotels, and airlines, and they will be able to direct that to their favorite schools, teachers, nonprofits, or even their own tuition and textbooks. What Campus Reps Will Do ClassWish Campus Reps will help raise awareness of this opportunity for students, professors, and their families to generate funding for schools, nonprofits, and college tuition. We will recruit a campus rep on each college campus. They, in turn, will recruit additional campus reps to focus on each of these areas: Greek life Residence halls Athletics Student government Student clubs and organizations Professors and administration Alumni Student media Social media Events Graphics Communications Marketing We Want to Hear From Outstanding Students Interested in becoming a Campus Rep?

We expect to engage thousands of high school and college students in China to work online and raise awareness of ClassWish.org so that we can improve schools and education for American students.

They will also appear on web banner ads that we design specifically for each of them. We will secure donated ad inventory from fashion magazines, websites, blogs, schools, and retailers. The ClassWish PSA ads will feature the celebrities involved in the program. We will build Cause Marketing and promotional campaigns with fashion brands and retailers. For instance, we are working on one campaign now: 'Win a wardrobe for yourself and one for your favorite teacher.&rsquo; We will seek editorial coverage of the campaign from fashion magazines and websites. We will use social media to reinforce these campaigns. We are a small organization, so we seek outstanding students who can take a leadership role.

FAQ - Review ClassWish.org&rsquo;s outstanding internship program here: Is this a business or a nonprofit? ClassWish is a nonprofit, but we use the latest techniques from the business world to make a leveraged, scalable and financially-self sustaining difference in the lives of tens of millions of children. This sounds ambitious! Daniel Burnham, the great Chicago architect, said \\\"Make no little plans; they have not the power to stir men&rsquo;s souls.\\\" (Nor women&rsquo;s, we hasten to add). Little plans also do not have the power to provide a better education to 56 million kids who deserve more than they are getting today. We face a crushing need in schools, have a solid plan to address it, and with your help, we intend to grow this very large and very fast. Where are you located? We are in Manhattan, conveniently located right across from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. Four express subway stops, LIRR, and the PATH train are all within one block. We also hire interns to work remotely from other cities. What skills and experience are you looking for? We seek a wide range of skills: graphic designers, videographers, writers, researchers, creative thinkers, analytical sorts, community organizers, social media stars, people with great communication skills, MBA students, and more. I looked at your site and have some suggestions. Great! This is a collaborative project, and we want to hear from you. Your ClassWish review will be helpful. Is this a paid internship? We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your rsum, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions. Do check to see if your school offers a stipend program. When will you select the interns? We&rsquo;re agile. When we see a great candidate, we extend an invitation immediately. We won&rsquo;t keep you waiting for a decision. What dates will the internship run? We are flexible. Tell us what you are looking for. What are the hours? We welcome full-time and part-time interns. Let us know what works for you. What will I need to bring? Brains, heart, passion, energy, a notebook computer (as an early-stage nonprofit, we just can&rsquo;t afford to buy dozens of machines), and a passion to make an immediate improvement to the education of tens of millions of children.

FAQ - Review ClassWish.org&rsquo;s outstanding internship program here: Is this a business or a nonprofit? ClassWish is a nonprofit, and we are working with Have to Have, an exciting new for-profit lifestyle website to make a big difference in the lives of tens of millions of children. This sounds ambitious! Daniel Burnham, the great Chicago architect, said \\\"Make no little plans; they have not the power to stir men&rsquo;s souls.\\\" (Nor women&rsquo;s, we hasten to add). Little plans also do not have the power to provide a better education to 56 million kids who deserve more than they are getting today. We face a crushing need in schools, have a solid plan to address it, and with your help, we intend to grow this very large and very fast. This sounds much better than the usual cookie dough sales from so many schools. ClassWish.org is the new solution for school fundraising so every teacher can get the classroom supplies (s)he needs. Where are you located? Right in Manhattan, across from Madison Square Garden, within one block of four express subway stops, PATH, LIRR, and NJ Transit.

Tell us what you&rsquo;ve got. I looked at the two websites and have some suggestions. Great! This is a collaborative project, and we want to hear from you.

We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your r\u00e9sum\u00e9, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions. When will you select the interns? We&rsquo;re agile. When we see a great candidate, we extend an invitation immediately. We won&rsquo;t keep you waiting for a decision. What dates will the internship run? We are hiring for the summer, for the fall semester, and beyond. Tell us what you are looking for. What are the hours? We welcome full-time and part-time interns. Let us know what works for you. What will I need to bring? Brains, heart, passion, energy, and passion. We also need you to bring your own notebook computer.

Use your skills and also improve the education and lives of schoolchildren and to make school fundraising easier and more efficient than ever. We are looking for passionate, energetic students with exceptional skills. This is an outstanding leadership opportunity in an innovative start-up nonprofit organization. Here is the problem we are tackling: K-12 schools in this country do not have enough resources to let children explore their potential and excel. Books, computers, art supplies, musical instruments, science equipment, sports equipment, and even paper for computers and printers are all in desperately short supply. Our Approach: ClassWish . org, an exciting new nonprofit, uses modern business practices and the latest marketing techniques to help 125,000 schools serving 56 million kids, inform, inspire and engage supporters. Teachers visit the site to create Wish Lists of the resources they need. People in the community can see exactly what is needed and contribute to help. About Us: The people behind ClassWish.org include such prominent education and business leaders as Adam Hirsch, former COO, Mashable; Laurie Coots, CMO, TBWA; Scott Cutler, EVP, New York Stock Exchange; Betsy Morgan, former CEO, Huffington Post; Nancy Pelz-Paget, Director, Education and Society Program, Aspen Institute; Sharon Robinson, CEO, American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education. Forbes Magazine liked our approach so much that they donated a full page to help raise awareness. Yo-Yo Ma, Tony Hawk and Dwight Howard are among the celebrities who have offered to help promote ClassWish.org. The work: We are looking for an outstanding bookkeeping intern to help us with financial reporting, controls and systems. You will take a leadership role on projects and work with other highly motivated interns, established professionals, and directly with our co-founder. What do we offer? You will enhance your resume with a solid record of professional achievement and community service, and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you have helped children get the tools they need to perform at their best. If you want a great experience doing something you will always be proud of, send a cover letter and a resume to interns @ ClassWish . org. Impress us. This is competitive. FAQ Is this a business or a nonprofit? We are a nonprofit, but we use the latest techniques from the business world to make a leveraged, scalable and financially-self sustaining difference in the lives of tens of millions of schoolchildren. This sounds ambitious! Daniel Burnham, the great Chicago architect, said \\\"Make no little plans; they have not the power to stir men&rsquo;s souls.\\\" (Nor women&rsquo;s, we hasten to add). Little plans also do not have the power to provide a better education to 56 million kids who deserve more than they are getting today. We face a crushing need in schools, have a solid plan to address it, and with your help, we intend to grow this very large and very fast. Where are you located? We are in Manhattan, conveniently located right across from Madison Square Garden. Four express subway stops are within one block. We will also hire interns to work remotely from other cities (but for other roles, not bookkeeping). What skills and experience are you looking for? This posting is for a bookkeeping intern. We also seek interns with a wide range of skills: graphic designers, videographers, writers, researchers, creative thinkers, analytical sorts, community organizers, social media stars, people with great communication skills, MBA students, and more.

A pioneering nonprofit, Heifer International, has shown that nonprofits can capture some of that money by making donations, given in a friend&rsquo;s name, feel like a present. It works! They raise $115 million a year this way. Imagine how much more gift money could be captured by nonprofits addressing popular causes, including your favorites. The challenge is that it is too daunting for most nonprofits to provide a gift-like experience: tangible donation opportunities, wish lists, gift registries, and personalized printed greeting cards. About www.ChangingThePresent.org Our nonprofit site provides a gift-like experience, which helps 400 leading nonprofits capture money normally spent on traditional presents. The NY Times called it an \\\"amazon.com of the nonprofit world.\\\" We are now about to invite all million nonprofits to join the site. We are also providing each with their own private, charitable gift sites so they can send supporters without exposing them to other nonprofits. See a sample: http://SampleNGO.GiftsForHumanity.org. We facilitate this type of giving for individuals and nonprofits, and we promote this as a social norm. The Office Environment This is a great place to work. We have interns and volunteers from all over the United States and all around the world. The atmosphere is energetic, creative, and fun. We value brainstorming, initiative, sharing, and collaborating. Think of it is a laboratory, studio, seminar, or incubator. We are also casual.

A pioneering nonprofit, Heifer International, has shown that nonprofits can capture some of that money by making donations, given in a friend&rsquo;s name, feel like a present. It works! They raise $115 million a year this way. Imagine how much more gift money could be captured by nonprofits addressing popular causes, including your favorites. The challenge is that it is too daunting for most nonprofits to provide a gift-like experience: tangible donation opportunities, wish lists, gift registries, and personalized printed greeting cards. About www.ChangingThePresent.org Our nonprofit site provides a gift-like experience, which helps 400 leading nonprofits capture money normally spent on traditional presents. The NY Times called it an \\\"amazon.com of the nonprofit world.\\\" We are now about to invite all million nonprofits to join the site. We are also providing each with their own private, charitable gift sites so they can send supporters without exposing them to other nonprofits. See a sample: http://SampleNGO.GiftsForHumanity.org.

About ChangingThePresent.org The New York Times called ChangingThePresent.org an \\\"amazon.com of the nonprofit world\\\" for our work in helping 400 leading nonprofits capture money normally spent on traditional presents. At the same time that a million nonprofits desperately need more funds to accomplish their missions, Americans spend $450 billion a year on birthday, holiday, and other presents. Most of those presents are not very rewarding. Tons of sweaters, fuzzy slippers, and ties end up in the dark corners of our closets. It is no surprise that a growing number of people, who seek meaning more than things, are starting to show their love by donating in a friend&rsquo;s name in lieu of giving traditional presents. The challenge for nonprofits is that it is simply too daunting to provide the requisite gift-like experience (tangible charitable gifts, wish lists and registries, and personalized printed greeting cards) that can make a donation feel like a rewarding gift. ChangingThePresent.org provides those tools to facilitate this type of giving for nonprofits and donors. We are about to take ChangingThePresent to the next level. That involves expanding from the initial 400 organizations to invite all 1.1 million nonprofits; adding additional causes and categories. Within each cause area, we will seek growth funding, invite advisors, recruit nonprofits, use media and social media to raise awareness among the public, and recruit celebrities to lend their voices. Imagine the impact we can make together as more and more people adopt this type of meaningful giving. Focus on Your Favorite Cause or Professional Field As well as HR, we also seek interns interested in each charitable cause and most professional fields, including strategy, partnerships, finance, communications, social media, graphics, research, community management, fundraising, sponsorships, Public Relations (PR), marketing, event management, organizing, and activism.

We are leading a movement to encourage students, faculty, recent graduates, high school students, and parents to advocate for these changes. The Petition Colleges and universities could save students billions of dollars a year on textbooks by adopting these policies. We call on them to: Consider the cost when selecting textbooks. Use free Open Source textbooks whenever possible. Do not require university-specific editions or (unless essential) the latest edition, which undermine the used book market. Refrain from requiring students to purchase expensive access codes for homework assignments and quizzes. Tell students what textbooks are required and what they cost before registration begins so they have time to shop for savings. Have college bookstores transparently serve students, rather than profit off of them. Inform students of scholarships to fund textbooks. Have college libraries put enough textbooks on reserve for in-house use. Support book exchanges for students to trade used books. Establish a standing student-faculty committee dedicated to this issue. A Nonprofit Movement Free The Textbooks is a nonprofit movement. We are glad to help you receive college credit for this internship. Use Your Skills in Communications and Public Relations Communications is, of course, a key element in growing the movement. We need to reach national media, student media, student organizations, social media channels, and others to raise word of the problem and of our solution.

We are looking for passionate, energetic students with exceptional skills to take initiative on a range of projects. This is an outstanding leadership opportunity in an innovative start-up nonprofit organization. Here is the problem we are tackling: K-12 schools in this country do not have enough resources to let children explore their potential and excel. Books, computers, art supplies, musical instruments, science equipment, sports equipment, and even paper for computers and printers are all in desperately short supply. Our Approach: ClassWish.org, an exciting new nonprofit, uses modern business practices and the latest marketing techniques to help 125,000 schools serving 56 million kids, inform, inspire and engage supporters. Teachers visit the site to create Wish Lists of the resources they need. People in the community can see exactly what is needed and contribute to help. About Us: The people behind ClassWish.org include such prominent education and business leaders as Adam Hirsch, former COO, Mashable; Laurie Coots, CMO, TBWA; Scott Cutler, EVP, New York Stock Exchange; Betsy Morgan, former CEO, Huffington Post; Nancy Pelz-Paget, Director, Education and Society Program, Aspen Institute; Sharon Robinson, CEO, American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education. Forbes Magazine liked our approach so much that they donated a full page to help raise awareness. Yo-Yo Ma, Tony Hawk and Dwight Howard are among the celebrities who have offered to help promote ClassWish.org. The work: Teachers and students are already getting supplies from ClassWish.org. Now, we need to raise greater awareness and encourage more participation so we can help more kids. Interns will work in small teams focused on such things as: marketing to particular audiences, such as businesses, bloggers, press, educators, moms, religious organizations, civic organizations, unions, nonprofits, authors, soap operas, magazine readers, teens and celebrities marketing around particular school subjects, such as science, music, art, reading and sports marketing around particular promotions (such as http://ClassWish.org/days and http://ClassWish.org/books/124) creating and implementing social media campaigns building and managing relationships with strategic partners such as http://EdRover.com building and leading a national network of volunteers enhancing the website creating graphics and promotional materials You will take leadership on projects and work with other highly motivated interns, established professionals, and directly with our co-founder. What do we offer? You will enhance your resume with a solid record of professional achievement and community service, and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you have helped children get the tools they need to perform at their best. If you want a great experience doing something you will always be proud of, send a cover letter and a resume to interns@ClassWish.org. Impress us. This is competitive. FAQ Is this a business or a nonprofit? ClassWish is a nonprofit, but we use the latest techniques from the business world to make a leveraged, scalable and financially-self sustaining difference in the lives of tens of millions of children. This sounds ambitious! Daniel Burnham, the great Chicago architect, said \\\"Make no little plans; they have not the power to stir men's souls.\\\" (Nor women's, we hasten to add). Little plans also do not have the power to provide a better education to 56 million kids who deserve more than they are getting today. We face a crushing need in schools, have a solid plan to address it, and with your help, we intend to grow this very large and very fast. Where are you located? We are in Manhattan, conveniently located right across from Madison Square Garden. We will also hire interns to work remotely from other cities. What skills and experience are you looking for? We seek a wide range of skills: graphic designers, videographers, writers, researchers, creative thinkers, analytical sorts, community organizers, social media stars, people with great communication skills, MBA students, and more. I looked at your site and have some suggestions. Great! This is a collaborative project, and we want to hear from everyone. Is this a paid internship? We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your resum\u00e9, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions. When will you select the interns? We're agile. When we see a great candidate, we extend an invitation immediately. We won't keep you waiting for a decision. What dates will the internship run? We are hiring for the summer, for the fall semester, and beyond. Tell us what you are looking for. What are the hours? We welcome full-time and part-time interns. Let us know what works for you. What will I need to bring? Brains, heart, passion, energy, a notebook computer, and a passion to make an immediate improvement to the education of tens of millions of children. Sounds exciting!

Our goal is to put together a volunteer team that can edit the groundbreaking work being done at The Actors Theatre Workshop. Using your professional skills to edit this wonderful material will surely stimulate hope, excitement and I believe bring true enlightenment to those who participate. At the same time you will reach another dimension in your craft as you learn about the unique filming/editing perspective of the ATW Founder and Artistic Director, Thurman E. Scott. ATW has long been on the front lines of disciplined creative training for theater professionals and individuals committed to fulfilling their creative potential. ATW has also been a safe haven for thousands of at-risk and homeless youth. The original theater and educational technique which has been tremendously successful with our professional acting students, has proven to be equally beneficial to the children we teach in our after-school programs. We have many years of footage from our adult acting workshop's and community program's that we want to share with you and the world. We've started sharing this video online and we've received such positive feedback from every corner of the globe that we are taking steps to put out more. This process takes time and so we would like to find more dedicated individuals who want to learn and make a difference in other people's lives and be a part of something hopeful by joining our video editing team. Our editors often talk about the beautiful, inspiring and deeply moving moments they have witnessed when a student actor or a child from a homeless shelter brings forth his talent and reaches for their potential. You literally see the moments when there is a shift in consciousness and they begin to accept their strength and the unique gifts that they have to offer the world. And in that moment you know that this person has changed forever-- and as a result undoubtedly so have you. By working directly with this material you will gain deep insight into the emotional and psychological breakdown of drama, and learn to see the penetrating insights that come out of script analysis, which gives you the ability to find and understand the eternal essence of ideas that are then formulated into a universal idea that helps to instill faith and spread hope to all individuals on a creative journey.

Successful non-profits are built on powerful ideas that inspire hope. These ideas are manifested in the programs and the management of the organization. By gaining a working understanding of how to successfully manage a nonprofit organization, the intern begins to learn its core principals, which allows the intern to begin to take a leadership role in the organization. In addition, this knowledge is invaluable in the creation of videos that effectively promote and bring this work to the world. These videos are essential to the marketing and fund-raising efforts in any successful non-profit. We are looking for individuals with the ability to lead, manage teams, work independently, communicate effectively on the phone, in person and in writing and interact in a fast-paced business environment. We are looking for idealists and leaders who can put their thoughts and insights into action; positive, enthusiastic individuals who want to make a difference in the world and are committed to upholding the legacy and tradition of theater in the belief that theater can change a life and make the world a better place for everyone. The interns' primary responsibility is to manage the daily administrative operations of the organization and to take a leadership role in programming initiatives. There will be opportunities to work closely with the senior staff: in administrating over workshops for actors and community programs that serve Youth-at-Risk and homeless children. Under ATW supervision, interns will be accountable for projects in the management of ATW's studio rental business, administration, team management, marketing, development, sales, fund-raising, video production, event planning, and graphic design. For international applicants, English proficiency is required. In addition, Interns may also work on a combination of logging, editing, and production of on-going video projects that depend on ATW's current schedule and on the intern's skill level. Interns will work under the direction of a project manager. We seek applicants with training and experience logging footage, editing in Final Cut Pro, http streaming, digital shooting, lighting, sound and web design and development. Interns and Volunteers consistently report they gain tremendously from filming and reviewing footage of ATW classes and workshops and have benefited as if they had actually taken the classes themselves. In summary, we seek professional, detail-oriented individuals who are positive and curious, with a desire to learn and engage in a process. The Actors Theatre Workshop is an award-winning non-profit theater, educational institution and community center in NYC founded by award-winning actor, director, writer and producer, Thurman E.

BRC helps these neediest New Yorkers overcome the challenges of addiction, physical and mental illness, and poverty, and improves life in the community. Outreach is BRC's program for homeless individuals living on the streets and in other unstable situations. It is the most extensive outreach program in New York City covering specific Manhattan based locations, i.e. Grand Central Station, Penn Station and Port Authority Bus Terminal, 5 days per week in vans and on foot. Outreach staff and volunteers engages homeless individuals with the goal of assessing each individual's situation and needs and providing each client with an accessible doorway to services they need. Clients are afforded referral, transportation and placement at the resource deemed most beneficial to the individual, and each is treated with respect, professionalism and informed guidance. The Outreach Team encounters many individuals that are reluctant to use services or have found the available resources unmanageable and overwhelming. These clients are provided with counseling, information and advocacy in pursuing services, rights and resources. Every individual engaged is given the opportunity to access the services most suited to their needs.

Our mission is to come together with an open mind, as equals, to sit together with the clients make art, listen to music, have something to eat and talk.

The meetings are an opportunity to introduce ourselves to each other and start the morning off with positive conversation about the day. Following the meeting one of the volunteers teachers will introduce the project for the day. Supplies are then passed out, tables pushed together to encourage conversation and community, music is played, and then everyone starts to make their project. Towards the end of the class we collect the work, hang in on the wall, and then one by one we talk about what we did, why we made it, how we felt about the project, etc. Responsibilities include helping to set up for class, joining in making your own art work as you encouraging clients to make their own work, particapating in end-of-class conversations where we view and discuss the work everyone has produced in class, and putting supplies away.

They are in essence, the voice of the child, in court. CASA Volunteers interview parents, doctors, educators, foster parents, therapists, and anyone else involved in the life of the child they are assigned. Their goal is to provide child-focused reports to the court, which will lead to a speedy, safe, and permanent placement for the child. This is why it is imperative for these volunteers to go through extensive training. All Volunteers are screened closely for objectivity, competence, and commitment. You can become a CASA volunteer if: You have never been convicted of a crime and can pass a criminal background check. You are not personally involved with DCP&P (the state child welfare agency). Your job (and your life) is flexible. You are at least 21 years old. You are willing to make a one-year commitment. You pass CASA&rsquo;s screening process. Typically, a CASA volunteer will spend an average 10-20 hours per month working with their assigned case. Each case is different, so the amount of time required to get the job done varies significantly. We do require the volunteer to visit the child once every two weeks and be in court once every three months. CASA for Children of Bergen County asks that you make a one-year commitment. We prefer that a volunteer continue with their assigned case until it is permanently resolved which typically involves an 18 months - two year commitment. One of the primary benefits of the CASA program is that, unlike many caseworkers, most CASA volunteers remain a consistent figure during the course of case proceedings. This provides important continuity for children. Potential CASA volunteers must attend an Information Session, be interviewed and be accepted into training. CASA provides extensive training for our volunteers so that they are prepared to provide children with the support they desperately need. CASA volunteers undergo a thorough 36-hour training course. They learn about courtroom procedure, effective advocacy techniques for children, and specific topics ranging from child abuse to early childhood development and adolescent behavior. In addtion, trainees must attend 3 hours of court observation before being sworn-in by the presiding Family Court judge. Volunteers are required to attend 12 hours of continued training for each year of service. Our training course is offered several times a year and will prepare you for your volunteer experience.

Citizen Schools brings volunteers to middle schools to teach hundreds of relevant subjects--and launch new dreams. At Citizen Schools, middle-school students work side by side with experts to explore new fields, learn new skills, and create something real for their community. Once a week, volunteer Citizen Teachers partner with middle schools in low-income communities to teach apprenticeships in a wide range of subjects. Teams and individuals from corporations, civic organizations, universities, and associations lead courses about things they're passionate about, exposing young people to new futures through ten weekly lessons. Each curriculum is designed to make academic and 21st Century standards connect to careers and real life. And each one culminates in a WOW!--a presentation of the students' work before an adult audience, building students' oral communication and teamwork skills. Independent studies show that Citizen Schools apprentices get better grades, have better attendance, and graduate at a higher rate than their peers--and that volunteers gain professional skills like teamwork, communication, project management, and leadership.

This workshop needs your support at an elementary school in Inwood: Program 985GC-M Friday, February 17th, 2017 2 consecutive classes: 9:00 - 10:00 AM & 10:15 - 11:15 AM (Please choose one or both) Writing Coach Fifth-graders in two back-to-back classes read What&rsquo;s Up in the Amazon Rainforest by Ginjer Clarke to learn about the region&rsquo;s indigenous animals. With a focus on endangered species, they'll describe an animal, report how it has adapted to its environment, and tell a story about it. Writing coaches will help small groups of students stay focused, provide support and encouragement, and answer their questions about spelling and grammar.

We also provide schools with assistance in the development of their own external support organizations, which build networks of donors, volunteers and partners that support literacy-focused education at their schools. The Foundation is the official charity for the Brooklyn 5K/10k/15k in Prospect Park. We will be helping to administer the race, as well as raising funds to support our writing programs and partner schools. We are also getting kids into the action! Not only will students be running the race, but as a new journalism program at FFL, we will have students covering the action as journalists, photographers, bloggers, interviewers, and live social media correspondents. We are inviting folks to help us as race day volunteers to help out on the course, as volunteers with the kids, or to run or walk one of the distances (you can either run 5k, 10k, 15k or with a kid in the 2k kids race). The race will work just like a typical \\\"fun run\\\" for charity, but in the context of a large race. FFL's partners in organizing the Brooklyn 15k (Pacific Sports and Active Network), have given us a guaranteed number of entries into the race at all of the distances (so we're protected against a sell-out).

Our International students need : -A caring and friendly host family who is willing to provide quiet space for studying, access to TV and internet, and access to laundry facilities. -A private bedroom (not in the basement please) and a shared or private bathroom in a safe and clean environment. -Breakfast and dinner meals with host family during the week. (The student would buy their lunch at school) and 3 meals during the weekend. (Most international students like to share meals with their American hosts every day.
