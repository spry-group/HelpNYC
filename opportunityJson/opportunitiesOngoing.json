Here is an opportunity to help underprivileged children, to help under-served children, to help ALL children, and even to help adults who can't read. Have you ever wanted to be a part of an amazing convergence of forces that is about to change the way the whole world does something? Have you ever heard anyone talk about a problem and say, \\\"that problem is impossible to fix,\\\" or, \\\"that's the way it's always been; there's no changing it.\\\" Well, people say that about world hunger, world peace, and low literacy. Two years ago, the Barbara Bush Foundation and Dollar General sponsored the $7million XPrize for Adult Literacy to bring in teams from around the world to develop an app-based solution to the adult literacy crisis in America. The parameters of the contest were that teams had to build an app that would teach reading to illiterate and low literate adults without any assistance from another adult (an \\\"independent learning\\\" app). At the American Youth Literacy Foundation (dba Youth Lit and YouthLit.org), our focus has always been on children's literacy. We joined this competition but opted out after a year. However, during that year we learned a lot, and since engaging in that experience, we have seen the future potential for this new, digital approach to the reading crisis. In the past several months we have made major progress on our own \\\"independent learning,\\\" smartphone app for children's literacy. Today we are further along than ever in the creation of this amazing new learning tool that teaches children how to read with little to no intervention required by a grown-up or older sibling or a tutor. The app is a digital representation of our patented reading curriculum that we have been using nationwide, for the past 10 years, the same curriculum we've been training tutors in, who, in turn, have taught thousands of children how to read. But now we need volunteers like you to help us put the prototype of the app in the hands of kids who are learning how to read so they can play with it and provide critical feedback that will help us finish the app and make it available to kids everywhere for FREE downloading from the Apple store and Google play. We believe that this app could literally solve the literacy crisis in America. If you have an interest in being a reading mentor to a child and want to help with this project, if you like working with kids, if you want to help them learn how to read, if literacy is something that you feel passionate about, and if finding a lasting solution to the literacy crisis is something you want to get involved in, then please reply today. We need your help. Thank you! We truly look forward to hearing from you : ) Please include a short note telling us about your interest in literacy. We will provide you with a letter explaining our tutoring program and more about this opportunity.

This is a great opportunity for students who are majoring (or have already earned a degree) in the course area to enhance their knowledge and experience and who are interested in tutoring. In this role, you would collaborate with an instructor to improve students&rsquo; performance while being supported and guided by an experienced academic support professional. All tutors for Sociology classes are expected to commit a minimum of one hour and fifteen minutes in-class, and two hours availability outside of class each week to support students having difficulty with the material. You would identify and support students who are struggling, moderate the online blog used to facilitate class discussion, and provide feedback to the instructor regarding students' concerns and difficulties that can lead to changes in future lessons. You might also design videos or assignments, and create differentiated instruction as the need arises. You will be supported throughout this process by the City Tutors staff. Tutors providing virtual support outside of the class also need to maintain a reliable internet connection in a relatively quiet space for a minimum of 1 hour sessions. All tutors are also expected to complete a four session comprehensive, professional training regimen. 6 hours of live training, plus another hour and a half for orientation. This is a commitment of 7.5 hours of in person training, and 4 hours of supplemental training for a total of 11.5 hours of training over the course of the Fall semester. Training days will be determined based on your schedule and that of the Tutor Training Coordinators. CT's tutoring program has been successful in helping students gain access to support that they otherwise would not have received, given their limited time spent on campus. Having a tutor in the class early in the semester will allow us to employ strategies to reduce withdrawals and student failure rates.

Often, regularly scheduled visits are requested, however Music Volunteers may also be asked to provide musical visits on an occasional basis for one patient/family or for a group of patients at a facility as outreach for the local hospice agency. Hospice is built on the philosophy that we care for our patients in mind, body and soul. Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, memory bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network. They often make phone calls to check up on family members and also send cards of comfort and care.

For many children who face grief early in their lives, it can be a very isolating experience due to a lack of understanding and a lack of supportive people who understand their emotions and needs. Good Grief, a nonprofit in Morristown and Princeton, New Jersey, specializes in supporting the needs of grieving children through free peer support programs, education, and advocacy. Good Grief was created in 2004 and serves over 550 participants every month. However, not everyone who would like to benefit from our services has the opportunity to do so due to transportation and other needs. In order to meet the needs of urban youth, Good Grief created In Community, a program that supports underserved children and families. In Community launched in Jersey City in 2018, and caters to children ages 6-18 who have experienced the loss of someone important in their lives, as well as providing support to their parent or guardian so that they can learn how to better understand their children&rsquo;s needs. In April 2019, we will expand our reach to the families of Newark and hope you will join us along the way! In Community will reduce isolation by creating a community of children of similar ages who have experienced loss, as well as give them the tools to develop healthy coping skills to adapt to their current and other adversities they may experience.

Often, regularly scheduled visits are requested, however Music Volunteers may also be asked to provide musical visits on an occasional basis for one patient/family or for a group of patients at a facility as outreach for the local hospice agency. Hospice is built on the philosophy that we care for our patients in mind, body and soul. Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, memory bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network. They often make phone calls to check up on family members and also send cards of comfort and care.

Sprout is a non-profit organization based in New York City focused on providing innovative programs for adults with developmental disabilities.With our network of resources and dedicated volunteers, which we call leaders, Sprout opens up fascinating new worlds to people with disabilities. Sprout's Overnight Vacations Program is looking for individuals who have the energy, motivation and desire to work with adults with developmental disabilities. What do Sprout leaders do? Sprout leaders' primary goal is to give adults with developmental disabilities the opportunity to experience and enjoy recreational, educational and leisure activities through overnight vacations. Leaders are responsible for the overall safety and enjoyment of their group, 24 hours a day, while on a Sprout trip. Duties include safety monitoring, personal hygiene assistance, providing physical and emotional support, activity planning, budgeting, logistics, and enhancing fun. The work is hard yet immensely rewarding as you develop leadership skills and gain insight into your own abilities. What type of training is provided? Leaders must complete a pre-service training, which provides the necessary procedures and tools to run a successful and enjoyable vacation. Leaders who are drivers receive extra training on how to safely drive our 15-passenger vans. In addition, all leaders receive a copy of Sprout's Leadership Handbook to help with policies and guidelines. What is the time commitment? Sprout vacations last 3 - 7 days depending on the time of year and destination of the trip. When a leader is selected for an overnight vacation, Sprout asks that the leader dedicate themselves to stay with their group throughout the entire duration of the vacation. Some leaders only choose to lead one trip a year while others spend several months with us leading up to 8 trips or more. Sprout strives to make our program flexible for our leaders based on the amount of time leaders can give. Do leaders have any free or personal time while on a trip? Sprout trips are working vacations for the leaders who choose to participate. Because Sprout leaders are responsible for their group 24 hours a day, there is no free or personal time allotted. In order to give our participants the opportunity to experience and enjoy a vacation, Sprout leaders must be available at all times to provide the support any one participant may need. What type of trips can Sprout leaders expect to join? A majority of Sprout trips take place within a day's drive of New York City. Destinations include Atlantic City, Amish Country, Boston, Lake George, Cleveland, Maine and Virginia Beach. Exotic trips like cruises, Hawaii, and Europe are presented to leaders who have demonstrated high levels of commitment, service hours and have gained positive feedback from participants and Sprout office staff. Are there any special skills or requirements? No special background or education is required to become a Sprout leader. We encourage people from all cultures and professions, and of all ethnic and educational backgrounds. Once accepted into the program, you will receive the necessary tools to sign up for outings and how to assist our participants. Requirements include: -21+ years old -Provide references -Participate in training session -Willingness to complete necessary background checks -Evaluate participants' behavior -Fluent English -Willing to drive a 15 passenger van -Love to travel & have fun!

Feel free to also check us out on our website to learn more about us at www.TEACH4Kids.org Who We Are: TEACH (Together Educating All Children in Hospitals) is an international not-for-profit organization that brings exciting, hands-on, STEM educational programming to children in hospitals. Our mission is to create an outlet for children of all ages to passionately engage with the sciences through the medium of fun, interactive experiments. Through engagement with practical science concepts, the children are challenged yet empowered. They emerge comforted and confident, encouraged to successfully cope with the trials that lie before them. TEACH modules challenge children to think creatively and bring an element of fun to an otherwise monotonous day. When TEACH volunteers visit, children get excited and get to experience STEM topics through more than 75 different interactive modules. Patients can learn about real life concepts while also having an exceptional amount of fun. They are amazed as they create silly putty while they learn about polymers and use basic engineering principles to build boats that really float. Observing the science of physiological respiration using yeast to inflate a balloon or discovering density by creating their very own lava lamps truly changes the way they view science, their stay in the hospital and life. What makes us special is that TEACH was founded by and is entirely run by students. In Spring 2013, TEACH&rsquo;s two co-founders were inspired to help with the need for interaction and activity, the craving for a personal bond, and the lack of mental and physical stimulation exhibited by hospitalized children. Under the mentorship and guidance of Dr. Edward Burns of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, TEACH was created to heal through teaching. TEACH began with monthly modules in a local Bronx hospital. In just over a year, TEACH grew to reach nine hospitals with hundreds of students signed up to volunteer from various universities around the tristate area. We have served 3000 children, 30 hospitals internationally, and 1000 volunteers. What TEACH Needs TEACH is seeking an enthusiastic and passionate individual that wants to make a difference in the lives of medically ill children. We need someone who is committed to the organization both in the time they commit to as well as a financial responsibility to support the organization. Our board members are required to be active within the organization and play a significant role in the growth of the organization. Board Member Responsibilities TEACH board meets quarterly and communicates via email and phone at various times throughout the year. We require board members to attend at least two meetings. Board members are required to assist fundraising efforts and participate in at least one committee. Some of the things that they would need to participate in would be to promote events, participate in peer to peer campaigns, in addition they would be required to either give a minimum of $500 to the organization personally or solicit donations for the organization. If the board members can give or get more it is welcomed.

The Brief was published nationally and showed: \uf0b7 Gross racial and ethnic disparities: approximately 90% are youth of color; 72% are African American males. \uf0b7 Justice by geography: Rates of incarceration in the adult prison system vary significantly across counties in New Jersey, suggesting that justice depends on where one lives, not on the facts of a given case. \uf0b7 Youth are regularly deprived of due process: Approximately 30% of the 472 youth waived to adult court during the study period spent more than 2 years incarcerated, between their arrest date and their sentencing date, violating their right to a speedy trial. \uf0b7 Youth are regularly put in solitary confinement - especially youth with mental health disorders: Although solitary confinement is known to be psychologically damaging, especially to children, 53% of these youth spent a total of approximately 15,359 days (42 years) in solitary confinement between 2010 and 2015; 5 percent spend over a year there, and about 4 percent spent 2 years or more in solitary. Nearly 70 percent of those placed in solitary had a mental health disorder, with nearly 37% having two or more diagnoses. \uf0b7 Youth suffer abuse while in adult prison: once incarcerated in an adult prison, one in four youth surveyed reported physical abuse; 5% reported sexual abuse.

Four-month-old Bosley is a puppy with a special mission. One day, he will provide enhanced independence and mobility to a person with disabilities - whether they're blind or visually impaired, or have a disability other than blindness. But Bosley isn't growing up at the Guide Dog Foundation for the Blind. Each year, the Guide Dog Foundation breeds about 300 exceptional puppies, and it's vital that Bosley and other pups like him spend the first year of their lives with surrounded by the love and security of volunteer foster families called puppy walkers. Puppy walkers help Foundation puppies grow up to be confident dogs. What's involved in raising a Guide Dog Foundation puppy? Bosley went to live with his puppy walkers when he was about nine weeks old. He's learning basic obedience and social skills while being exposed to many different situations. People who raise Guide Dog Foundation puppies say it is the most rewarding thing they've ever done. Puppy raisers come from everywhere - stay-at-home moms or dads, teachers, college students, retirees, people with flexible work environments - and are crucial members of the Guide Dog Foundation family. By opening their hearts and homes to a puppy, a puppy raiser plays a crucial role in helping a person with disabilities live an independent life. Every puppy walker family works with a Guide Dog Foundation puppy adviser, who is available to answer questions and offer guidance and support. When he is about 14 months old, Bosley will return to the Guide Dog Foundation's Smithtown campus to begin his training as a guide or service dog. Puppy raisers will admit it's tough to say good-bye, but when they see the pup they raised take its place at the side of someone with disabilities, the ache they feel turns pride. There are puppies waiting now to join your loving home for a chance to start their careers.

With your help, we can equip students with the foundational skills they need to read at grade level. Each week, you will meet with your student for a one-on-one tutoring session to help them develop strong literacy skills and discover a passion for reading. We'll provide a structured curriculum, in-person training, and ongoing support to help your student thrive. Rigorous research has proven that Reading Partners significantly increases reading proficiency. No teaching experience required and anyone over the age of 14 can volunteer.

Grace Healthcare Services is a Hospice organization that cares for patients throughout NJ. Veterans at the end of life. Volunteers are an essential component of this care. WHY A NEED FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS? -Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect to patients who have served our country. -Veterans share a common bond and code of conduct. -The camaraderie that exists between Veterans has proven to be a great support for the Veterans we care for. As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee. Please help us honor our Veterans by giving them the gift of your time.

We welcome your gifts of time and compassion. Whether you choose to work directly with patients and families or to volunteer in one of many other ways, you can make a profound difference in someone's life, including your own. Volunteers are an integral part of the hospice team. Volunteers are needed in all areas of NJ! Volunteer Opportunities: Companionship Volunteers work directly with patients providing companionship, offering friendly visits, reading to patients, writing letters, offering a gentle touch or sharing a quiet moment. Complementary Volunteers are certified/trained professionals who can provide complementary modalities of reflexology, music, imagery and touch therapies such as Reiki, massage, therapeutic touch and healing hands. Pet Therapy Volunteers provide certified/trained pets who visit with patients. These animals provide loving memories for some and give unconditional love helping our patients feel connected to a larger world. Administrative Volunteers provide help to the staff in our Edison office by assisting with typing, addressing cards, organizing newsletters, creating packets, collating manuals and other varied clerical duties Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, huggable dolls/bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Junior Volunteers consist of groups such as girl/boy scouts or young people who wish to honor our patients by making holiday cards, posters, wall hangings and memory books. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families and friends of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network. Hospice training classes are required for Companionship and Complementary Volunteers. They are free of charge and offered on an ongoing basis.

Grace Healthcare Services is a Hospice organization that cares for patients throughout NJ. Veterans at the end of life. Volunteers are an essential component of this care. WHY A NEED FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS? -Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect to patients who have served our country. -Veterans share a common bond and code of conduct. -The camaraderie that exists between Veterans has proven to be a great support for the Veterans we care for. As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee. Please help us honor our Veterans by giving them the gift of your time.

Reading is the foundation for all future learning. The ability to read transforms lives and empowers children to reach their full potential. Research shows that when students can read at grade level by fourth grade, they have a greater opportunity to succeed in school and beyond. With your help, we can equip students with the foundational skills they need to read at grade level. Each week, you will meet with your student for a one-on-one tutoring session to help them develop strong literacy skills and discover a passion for reading. We'll provide a structured curriculum, in-person training, and ongoing support to help your student thrive. Rigorous research has proven that Reading Partners significantly increases reading proficiency. No teaching experience required and anyone over the age of 14 can volunteer.

At participating locations, $1 or more from every Blizzard Treat sold will be donated to the local CMN Hospital beneficiary, Children&rsquo;s Specialized Hospital. Customers can also donate to the hospital by purchasing a Miracle Balloon at the register. Like all Children's Miracle Network Hospitals campaigns, donations raised will stay in the community to help local kids. As you can imagine the day is chaotic, but also a lot of fun. The stores are bursting at the seams, and the staff is overworked. It is no wonder some people don&rsquo;t even know what the day is about. We have found that when we can be at the Dairy Queen store to represent Children's Specialized Hospital, the results are so much better. But there are only so many of us. That is where you come in. We are looking for Children's Specialized Hospital Ambassadors from 2 p.m - 10 p.m. You will be talking about Children&rsquo;s Specialized Hospital to Customers and helping to collect donations. Shifts are every two hours: 2 - 4 p.m.; 4 - 6 p.m.; 6 p.m. - 8 p.m.; 8 - 10 p.m. Because of the heavy traffic of stores, we are asking for no more than 2 volunteers per shift. Requirements: You are outgoing, not afraid to talk to strangers, and not afraid to ask for a donation! You have knowledge of Children&rsquo;s Miracle Network Hospitals and Children's Specialized Hospital which you can gain through materials we will send you.

Here is an opportunity to help underprivileged children, to help under-served children, to help ALL children, and even to help adults who can't read. Have you ever wanted to be a part of an amazing convergence of forces that is about to change the way the whole world does something? Have you ever heard anyone talk about a problem and say, \\\"that problem is impossible to fix,\\\" or, \\\"that's the way it's always been; there's no changing it.\\\" Well, people say that about world hunger, world peace, and low literacy. Two years ago, the Barbara Bush Foundation and Dollar General sponsored the $7million XPrize for Adult Literacy to bring in teams from around the world to develop an app-based solution to the adult literacy crisis in America. The parameters of the contest were that teams had to build an app that would teach reading to illiterate and low literate adults without any assistance from another adult (an \\\"independent learning\\\" app). At the American Youth Literacy Foundation (dba Youth Lit and YouthLit.org), our focus has always been on children's literacy. We joined this competition but opted out after a year. However, during that year we learned a lot, and since engaging in that experience, we have seen the future potential for this new, digital approach to the reading crisis. In the past several months we have made major progress on our own \\\"independent learning,\\\" smartphone app for children's literacy. Today we are further along than ever in the creation of this amazing new learning tool that teaches children how to read with little to no intervention required by a grown-up or older sibling or a tutor. The app is a digital representation of our patented reading curriculum that we have been using nationwide, for the past 10 years, the same curriculum we've been training tutors in, who, in turn, have taught thousands of children how to read. But now we need volunteers like you to help us put the prototype of the app in the hands of kids who are learning how to read so they can play with it and provide critical feedback that will help us finish the app and make it available to kids everywhere for FREE downloading from the Apple store and Google play. We believe that this app could literally solve the literacy crisis in America. If you have an interest in being a reading mentor to a child and want to help with this project, if you like working with kids, if you want to help them learn how to read, if literacy is something that you feel passionate about, and if finding a lasting solution to the literacy crisis is something you want to get involved in, then please reply today. We need your help. Thank you! We truly look forward to hearing from you : ) Please include a short note telling us about your interest in literacy. We will provide you with a letter explaining our tutoring program and more about this opportunity.

You can become a CASA volunteer if: You have never been convicted of a crime and can pass a criminal background check. You are not personally involved with DCP&P (the state child welfare agency). Your job (and your life) is flexible. You are at least 21 years old. You are willing to make a one-year commitment. You pass CASA&rsquo;s screening process. Typically, a CASA volunteer will spend an average 10-20 hours per month working with their assigned case. Each case is different, so the amount of time required to get the job done varies significantly. We do require the volunteer to visit the child once every two weeks and be in court once every three months. CASA for Children of Bergen County asks that you make a one-year commitment. We prefer that a volunteer continue with their assigned case until it is permanently resolved which typically involves an 18 months - two year commitment. One of the primary benefits of the CASA program is that, unlike many caseworkers, most CASA volunteers remain a consistent figure during the course of case proceedings. This provides important continuity for children. Potential CASA volunteers must attend an Information Session, be interviewed and be accepted into training. CASA provides extensive training for our volunteers so that they are prepared to provide children with the support they desperately need. CASA volunteers undergo a thorough 36-hour training course. They learn about courtroom procedure, effective advocacy techniques for children, and specific topics ranging from child abuse to early childhood development and adolescent behavior. In addition, trainees must attend 3 hours of court observation before being sworn-in by the presiding Family Court judge. Volunteers are required to attend 12 hours of continued training for each year of service. Our training course is offered several times a year and will prepare you for your volunteer experience. Information Sessions: Wednesday, May 15 th at 10 am and 5:30 pm Saturday, June 15th at 10 am Wednesday, June 19 th at 10 am and 5:30 pm Next Training: TBD There are information sessions EVERY third Wednesday of the month!

Often, regularly scheduled visits are requested, however Music Volunteers may also be asked to provide musical visits on an occasional basis for one patient/family or for a group of patients at a facility as outreach for the local hospice agency. Hospice is built on the philosophy that we care for our patients in mind, body and soul. Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, memory bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network. They often make phone calls to check up on family members and also send cards of comfort and care.

Volunteer Opportunities: Companionship Volunteers work directly with patients providing companionship, offering friendly visits, reading to patients, writing letters, offering a gentle touch or sharing a quiet moment. Complementary Volunteers are certified/trained professionals who can provide complementary modalities of reflexology, music, imagery and touch therapies such as Reiki, massage, therapeutic touch and healing hands. Pet Therapy Volunteers provide certified/trained pets who visit with patients. These animals provide loving memories for some and give unconditional love helping our patients feel connected to a larger world. Administrative Volunteers provide help to the staff in our Edison office by assisting with typing, addressing cards, organizing newsletters, creating packets, collating manuals and other varied clerical duties Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, huggable dolls/bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Junior Volunteers consist of groups such as girl/boy scouts or young people who wish to honor our patients by making holiday cards, posters, wall hangings and memory books. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families and friends of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network.

All of us have gifts to share. Whether it be offering companionship by conversation, holding someone's hand, playing music, reading to them or just making them feel special. We ask you to share an hour or two a week, more if you're able to provide comfort and caring to those who will provide you with much more than you will ever imagine. Volunteer Opportunities: Companionship Volunteers work directly with patients providing companionship, offering friendly visits, reading to patients, writing letters, offering a gentle touch or sharing a quiet moment. Ascend Hospice is seeking certified Reiki, massage therapy and/or reflexology practitioners to serve our end of life population in finding comfort, relaxation and peace during their final time with us. These practices have proven to be beneficial during end-of-life care assisting with anxiety, emotional release and general comfort which is instrumental to patients and their families. Certification is required and hospice training is provided. Pet Therapy Volunteers provide companionship from our certified therapy dogs. Pet therapy provides numerous benefits like encouraging movement and physical stimulation and it provides mental benefits like socialization, mental stimulation, companionship, and unconditional love. Please consider sharing your loving pet with us and bring some much needed smiles. Pets must be certified as therapy animals by an organization like TDI Therapy Dogs International- see website here http://www.tdi-dog.org/ or in South Jersey - Bright and Beautiful Therapy Dogs - see website here http://www.golden-dogs.org/ Music Volunteers are volunteers who specialize in sharing songs or instrumental music with patients and their loved ones. Whether the Music Volunteer is sharing an existing musical skill or playing music via the radio or digital device, the goal is to enhance the quality of life of our patients. Often, regularly scheduled visits are requested, however Music Volunteers may also be asked to provide musical visits on an occasional basis for one patient/family or for a group of patients at a facility as outreach for the local hospice agency. Hospice is built on the philosophy that we care for our patients in mind, body and soul. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network. They often make phone calls to check up on family members and also send cards of comfort and care. For more information about our free volunteer training and available opportunities, call our Volunteer Department or visit our website at Ascendhospice.com. We look forward to hearing from you!

Camp AmeriKids is a one-week free summer camp for youth ages 8-16 who are infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS and/or sickle cell disease. We work with youth who might not normally be able to attend camp because of medical concerns and provide them with a traditional summer camp experience - all free of charge. We have a comprehensive medical team living at camp, available 24/7, which allows youth living with sickle cell, HIV/AIDS and other chronic illnesses to have a great time at camp while their families can be assured their health and well-being are monitored. In addition to our healthcare staff, we have a Wellness team overseen by a mental health professional. There is one child specialist assigned to each age group to assist counselors and staff members in managing any challenges associated with living in a new environment. The entire camp staff volunteer their time and energy to provide this incredible one-week experience for our youth. While we understand the difficulty in fully disengaging from the outside world, we expect volunteers to be present and engaged at all times to help create a fun, loving and safe environment for both staff and campers. Volunteers are given two nights off after campers have gone to bed and one period off each day to take a nap, grab a coffee or call home. Besides daily lessons in dance, drama, sports, arts & crafts, spoken word and more, we have a slew of special events. These include an evening luau, day at the carnival, a talent show and of course - campfires and s&rsquo;mores! Given the responsibilities involved in caring for children and the unique nature of our program, we take every precaution and screen all applicants extensively to ensure a good match. All volunteers are provided with housing and meals for the week. Mandatory orientation on Saturday, August 3 rd will acquaint you with camp and fellow volunteers to prepare before the campers arrive. Descriptions for cabin counselors, program and operations staff and preferred qualifications are below. To apply, please fill out a Volunteer Application online. For more information, email Executive Director Chloe Ettari at cettari@elm-project.org. CABIN COUNSELORS A team of counselors is responsible for the 24-hour supervision of a cabin and maintains a 2:1 camper to counselor ratio. The cabin counselor&rsquo;s enthusiastic participation in all aspects of camp is crucial in creating a memorable experience for our campers. We expect counselors to be completely engaged and participate in the fun alongside the kids - whether that&rsquo;s hopping in the pool, trying a new sport, or dancing on stage! Counselors are expected to be leaders and role models, as well as sources of energy and ideas. They are a key part of the Camp AmeriKids community. Qualifications Experience working with children Excellent team player and leadership skills Strong interpersonal and communications skills Flexible, energetic and creative (having skills or talents to teach campers is a plus!) Comfortable multi-tasking and working in a fast-paced, changing work environment Ability to relate well to people from diverse backgrounds and maintain confidentiality Ability to maintain a positive attitude under stress Passion for our mission and desire to work with children in a camp setting Program Staff Every summer we welcome a phenomenal crew of talented artists, performers and teachers from around the world to share their skills and experiences with our campers. Program staff facilitate learning and fun for campers in their area of expertise (i.e. dance, arts & crafts, sports). Each day, cabins will visit different program areas and participate in 45-minute activity periods. We expect program staff to come prepared with activities for campers of various age groups to learn and participate in - and be flexible when the schedule changes! In addition, we offer older campers (ages 12-16) the opportunity to choose a dedicated program area to attend every afternoon and work on a \\\"weekly project\\\" with a larger group. Campers will showcase their work on the last evening at our Talent Show - i.e. performing a short play, reciting original poetry, singing a song, or performing a choreographed group dance. Qualifications Personal or professional experience in at least one of the following areas: dance, theatre, arts & crafts, music, spoken word/poetry, sports, nature or film. If you have skills or talents not listed, we encourage you to apply and let us know what new program area you can teach! Experience working with or teaching children Flexible, energetic and creative Excellent interpersonal skills and strong communications skills Ability to maintain a positive attitude under stress Passion for our mission and desire to work with children in a camp setting Operations Team If you are interested in volunteering at camp without being directly responsible for campers&rsquo; daily care, operations might be the place for you.

A pioneering nonprofit, Heifer International, has shown that nonprofits can capture some of that money by making donations, given in a friend&rsquo;s name, feel like a present. It works! They raise $115 million a year this way. Imagine how much more gift money could be captured by nonprofits addressing popular causes, including your favorites. The challenge is that it is too daunting for most nonprofits to provide a gift-like experience: tangible donation opportunities, wish lists, gift registries, and personalized printed greeting cards. About www.ChangingThePresent.org Our nonprofit site provides a gift-like experience, which helps 400 leading nonprofits capture money normally spent on traditional presents. The NY Times called it an \\\"amazon.com of the nonprofit world.\\\" We are now about to invite all million nonprofits to join the site. We are also providing each with their own private, charitable gift sites so they can send supporters without exposing them to other nonprofits. See a sample: http://SampleNGO.GiftsForHumanity.org.

Companies help us by providing speakers for the STEM clubs that we hold, providing mentors to us, and providing field trip sponsorship for the middle schoolers. In essence, we need companies to help us with providing a future vision of what the clubs should be like at JerseySTEM - not just spent in class. The relationships with corporations is extremely important because they usually have an employee run Corporate Outreach club which can help us with spreading the word about JerseySTEM. Employees who give money to JerseySTEM are sometimes part of a corporation which will match the donation. So, we can either get volunteers or donations from those employees. In addition, the corporations can sell our name and promote us. There are about 300 potential company sponsors possible. You will work directly with our Analytics department to get data on which corporations to reach out to and to prioritize those corporations. This role directly impacts how many classes we can have because the companies sponsor the money for those classes (no money=no classes). Companies also sponsor the cost of the ride for college coaches to get to the class (no coaches = no class). This directly impacts our ability to get 25,000 middle schoolers taught by 2025. The role of the VP of Corporate Relations is to develop a network of connections with different stakeholders and decision makers within these companies and to manage a group of volunteers who represent JerseySTEM at these companies. Your role as a Managers will mean that you will be responsible for building your team (working with HR to recruit) and assigning tasks and engaging your volunteers (in JIRA).

In essence, we need companies to help us with providing a future vision of what the clubs should be like at JerseySTEM - not just spent in class. The relationships with corporations is extremely important because they usually have an employee run Corporate Outreach club which can help us with spreading the word about JerseySTEM.

In addition, the corporations can sell our name and promote us. There are about 300 potential company sponsors possible. You will work directly with our Analytics department to get data on which corporations to reach out to and to prioritize those corporations. This role directly impacts how many classes we can have because the companies sponsor the money for those classes (no money=no classes).
