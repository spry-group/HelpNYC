About The City Tutors (CT) is a volunteer tutoring program and non-profit organization with a goal to provide meaningful opportunities for volunteers to build professional skills and share their knowledge while helping to enhance and expand academic support to students in underserved programs around NYC. The City Tutors offers tutoring support and career development initiatives across four of the five boroughs as well as delivering academic services to all areas within the CCNY umbrella. The City Tutors is currently partnered with the Eisele Research Group, a nanotechnology group based out of the Center for Discovery and Innovation at the City College of New York. As part of a recently awarded NSF grant to the Eisele Research Group, an outreach program was created to present scientific concepts to students and communities throughout the city. The overall goal of this project is to increase public understanding of nanotechnology, and how fundamental research in nanoscience can pave the way to new renewable energy technologies. Increased public knowledge and engagement is only possible when the information is clearly disseminated to the public regarding what kind of research is being done and how the research can contribute to our society. Unfortunately, communicating and promoting science beyond a scientific audience proves challenging, a task that researchers themselves are not trained for. This project then aims to be a part of that change. The Eisele Group is partnering with Bronx Lacrosse, a student retention and support program that uses lacrosse as a vehicle to empower students both in and outside the classroom. Originally starting at the Highbridge Green School, it has expanded to support other middle schools within the Bronx Community. The project entails the creation of intriguing, simple to understand science lessons and activities for a middle school audience as part of a pilot initiative. The goal is to produce a minimum of 10 lessons/activities for students that will contain elements of professional development, conceptualization, lesson planning, presentation, and post-presentation phases, with periodic elements of sample student testing and evaluation. Members of the lab will use these short lessons/activities when giving talks about their work, and the activities will be made available to high school and undergraduate instructors.

Love to help people? HomeCare Options in Totowa, New Jersey, a licensed and accredited home health care agency, serving residents and families of Passaic County and northern New Jersey since 1954, is seeking new volunteer shoppers for their House Call Groceries for Seniors program. This all volunteer shopping group provides a very practical service for Seniors and handicapped residents throughout Passaic County who are homebound and no longer able to shop for groceries for themselves. Each shopper, simply by making themselves available to shop for a client, also brings an extra dose of caring and sunshine into the lives of people who often have few other people resources to rely on. Individual shoppers, husband/wife teams, and parent/teen shopping pairs are welcome to apply. Can you share a few hours of your time to help each week? every other week? or once each month? You choose how far you can travel to help, and which town(s) you are able to shop in. You can shop during the day, in the early evenings, or on weekends, depending on your schedule. We will find a match for you. Please call Julie Ford at (973) 310-9478 to learn more about this program. Once you are matched with a client, you contact your client first by phone, then make arrangements for a first shopping visit. You will go to your client's home to pick up a list and coupons, and the form of payment of course. Once you have shopped, you simply return to the client's home with the list, the groceries and the change, and if needed, help the client to put away the groceries. Clients are so happy to have someone to talk to, to have someone who can help! You will really make someone's day every time you shop!

We provide tax preparation for free to low-income taxpayers starting in mid-Feb. and continue through Mid-April. We are different from other free tax prep organizations in that our training (when accompanied with volunteer tax preparation) qualifies for CPE credit for CPA's - a definite benefit for the volunteer. Also, a benefit for tax payers is that we can file out of state and prior year forms, some forms not handled by VITA and other IRS free prep sites, and we also have people available year round if needed for follow-up tax info. Many of our clients have been with us for many years. Whether or not you experience filling out tax forms, we will train you until you are comfortable preparing tax returns for our clients.

The Comprehensive Community Hospice Program of Parker Jewish Institute is looking for people who would like to volunteer as a doula, going out to patients' homes and extending the hand of reassurance, offering a smile that warms the heart, and the words that say everything will be okay. Volunteer Doulas will help patients and families cope with the process of dying, remaining at the bedside as life ends. \\\"Doula\\\" is a Greek word that means \\\"woman servant or caregiver.\\\" Today it is associated with individuals who provide physical assistance and emotional support during and/or after childbirth. This proposed program aims to mirror the concept by providing the same type of support at the final phase of a terminal illness. This initiative will place a focus on planning for death with the elderly patient and family if there is one, and will provide a continuous around the clock vigil as death becomes imminent. The program will help the elderly patient who lacks family or adequate caregiver support to die comfortably, without fear of being alone. Even when surrounded by loved ones, individuals with a terminal illness and those closest to them may feel isolated as they face the end of life. As the end of life approaches, patients and families struggle with anxiety and fear; exhaustion; loved ones often feel alone, unprepared and afraid; and opportunities to explore meaning go unaddressed. Hospice Doulas provide emotional support and comfort to patients and their loved ones in the final phase of a terminal illness. Our End-of-Life (EOL) Doula volunteers will receive thorough training in understanding the dying process and in the skills that help bring peace and comfort to all involved. This free two-day training includes learning how to do guided visualization, help create rituals, provide simple physical support, offer sacred presence, as well as how to create spiritual and emotional legacies. Parker Jewish institute will be hosting a free two-day Doula training workshop on Saturday 10/28/17 and Sunday 10/29/17 from 9:00am-6:00pm. Breakfast and lunch will be served. A certificate will be awarded upon completion of this workshop. If you are interested in attending, please call the Hospice Program's Volunteer Doula Coordinator at 718-289-2134, or email volunteer-nerken@parkerinstitute.org. Doulas can come from any background and no experience is required. They typically work in as part of a team. They usually sit quietly with a patient, talk with them and offer support, comfort and companionship.

Consequently, we're always looking for volunteer softball coaches, particularly those with experience playing or coaching sports at the high school, college level and beyond. Currently, we have an emphasis and focus on finding more female softball coaches who can serve as role models for the girls in our program. We firmly believe that this plays a critical role in impacting the perceptions and future aspirations of our girls and how they see and understand leadership in the world. \\\"If I can see her, I can be her.\\\" Over the long term, we aspire to achieve at least a 50-50 gender split of coaches.

Therefore, we create Memory Books, in which we categorize items such as food, holidays, sports, cars, flowers/gardens, people, people showing emotion such as hugs, etc. Volunteers create these books by finding and cutting out pictures or scenes from magazines, cards, calendars, etc. We sit with the patients and review these categories to see if any memory is stimulated and many times it is. We have had great results with this over the years as a tool for the mental stimulation for these patients. It takes a lot of time, hours and dedication to put these books together and a great deal of material is needed to complete them.

Musicians MOC Volunteer Musicians perform acoustically at the bedsides of patients and are always accompanied by a trained MOC Volunteer Guide. Volunteer Musicians play one song per room and interact with patients, their families and hospital staff. All lyrics MUST be appropriate for a hospital setting, therefore MOC provides an approved song list for musicians to select their repertoire for hospital visits. Any other material outside of the approved song list may be submitted to MOC staff for approval. Musician applicants must also submit a sample of their music prior to acceptance into the program. Volunteer Musicians must complete MOC's training process which is outlined below. Guides Volunteer Guides escort Volunteer Musicians from room to room as they play music for patients. Volunteer Guides knock on each hospital room door and ask patients if they feel like hearing music. They also introduce the musicians prior to their performances and guide them through the facility. Each guide is assigned to a specific healthcare facility. The Volunteer Guide is the \\\"eyes and ears\\\" of MOC during the Bedside Performance Program as well as the liaison between the hospital and the Volunteer Musician.

WE NEED TUTORS RIGHT NOW to start supporting underserved children so they can build skills to do well on standardized tests and for entry into competitive, quality middle and high schools. We also seek a coordinator who can help us run this new program. Every weekend and free time you can give, let us know. We will assign you a child and you must be dedicated to that student at least three months. You can share the responsibility with another, but it must be intense and helpful for aspiring, hardworking students who come from underserved schools. Hours - Location will be at Grand Army Library or Eastern Parkway library or Medger Evers College or other location you can determine close to Flatbush, Crown Heights, Brownsville, Brooklyn. We want to add this to our soccer program and our Hip2B Healthy program, so we are thinking Saturday mornings, 9-1 or Sundays 12-4 or anytime between 9 am and 6 pm on Saturdays and 1-5 pm on Sundays. We can find other times and other locations. Children come from central Brooklyn (Crown Heights, etc) Background - We have an initiative with Seeds in the Middle to give every child a chance to learn the academic skills to gain entry into New York City's top high schools - starting as early as 3rd or 4th grade. Why? Despite increasing funding and initiatives, the percentage of African-American and Latino students in NYC is far below their numbers in the NYC population. See the article here - showing in 2017 that only 10 percent of the seats offered went to minority students. https://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2017/03/08/only-10-percent-of-offers-at-new-york-citys-specialized-high-schools-went-to-black-and-hispanic-students/ Who are we? Seeds in the Middle has been working with students, faculties and parents and the community in central Brooklyn since 2010. We have seen the challenges and want to work closely with people who care to give children real chances to get the same access to top colleges as those in more affluent communities. We think we have an innovative solution to helping students achieve so they can have an equal shot at these schools - including competitive schools like LaGuardia High School of Performing Arts or Midwood or Murrow or any other school recognized as top by the most competitive colleges. That's you! Help us create a new pathway for students! Empower real change. 2019-2020 - Volunteers who can help prepare students for the Specialized High School test are asked to commit at least two hours a week end for as long as you can commit (at least a month)... Next test is in fall 2020. ATTENTION - If you want to tutor younger ages or do anything further, read below For the long-term plan, WE ask for commitments of at least three months, or you can work for years with a student on special skills. You must: sign that commitment when you finish your term, explain to the next tutor what you are working on with the student confer with our certified educators for guidance so you know exactly what they need to work on. STUDENTS - WE CAN GIVE COMMUNITY SERVICE HOURS FOR THIS. Locations? May vary - it might be Brooklyn Central Library near Grand Army Plaza or a school in Brownsville, Flatbush or Crown Heights, Brooklyn or maybe right at Stuyvesant High School or one of the top high schools. If you have a location near a train, let us know. Who are the students you will tutor? Each student must write a letter or essay, saying why he or she wants to go to a top high school and signing, with a parent, their commitment to coming every week for as long as it takes. We are starting at 3rd or 4th grade, and offer this to students through 8th grade. We hope to launch this on MLK weekend 2018 - so respond right away. PS - We would like to ask every volunteer to donate $50 or anything to help support our efforts. If you just want to tutor and cannot give, that is okay. But this is an unfunded program, so we are asking for donations to pay the people who are creating and organizing these opportunities and to administer this. All donations are tax-deductible. If you are willing to fundraise at all - even a bake sale - for our efforts, we would truly appreciate. Our goal is $20,000 and we want to offer tutors to as many children who want it - can be 100 or more... you can see what we do at seedsinthemiddle.org and on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/seedsinthemiddle/ What is our goal? To get at least 20 students into any of these schools, maybe more.

We provide a calendar of volunteer and social events to help people get involved, have an impact, and have fun, without the requirements of long term commitments. After each volunteer event our volunteer team invites everyone to gather at a local restaurant or coffee shop where they can get to know one another in a relaxed social setting. Additionally we host regular social events for our volunteers to connect to one another and to welcome new volunteers to our community. We provide a flexible way for you to volunteer where and when you want. For this event, One Brick will be partnering with Rescuing Leftover Cuisine. About Our Partner: In the United States alone, 40 percent of food gets tossed every year - and that amouns to $162 billion in waste annually, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. This can serve 58,064,516,129 meals using the national average amount spent on a meal, $2.79. In order to address this issue of waster, Rescuing Leftover Cuisine helps bring food from our partners to a local homeless shelter. It takes less than an hour and you can set your own schedule, whether you want to help out daily, weekly, or sporadically. Our events at Rescuing Leftover Cuisine typically last 30 minutes (Some events are longer, some are shorter). On each event, we rescue an average of 50 pounds of food, which feeds about 40 people. It only take 30 minutes to help feed over 40 people! WHAT WE'LL BE DOING: Help rescue some prepared food and drinks from a restaurant in Midtown West! Heavyweight: the average amount of food rescued from this event is enough for a group of around five or so people. WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW: Please be aware volunteers should be able to carry a bag of food for a 15 to 30 minute walk. This event happens rain or shine. WHERE TO MEET: We will meet inside the restaurant. RESCUING LEFTOVER CUISINE: Rescuing Leftover Cuisine is a national 501(c)3 non-profit food rescue organization, operating in 16 cities and headquartered in New York City, that provides solutions to prevent excess wholesome cuisine from being wasted. RLC provides services such as food waste consulting, excess food delivery, co-branding services, and tax credit assistance. RLC approaches the two large issues of hunger and food waste in three main ways. First, we localize the issues into sets of communities that can help sustain themselves. We crowdsource the solution of the transportation to the members of the public in these communities as volunteers. After identifying the homeless shelters of a needy community, we proactively find restaurants, hotels, and catering companies with excess food in that vicinity that could help support these disadvantaged communities. Second, we leverage technology to facilitate the identification and handling of excess food. Thus, partner food providers report when excess food is occurring and a web application is used to engage community members, because volunteering with us can be as easy as taking a brisk walk. Third, we tackle food waste at its root, aiming to eliminate as much food waste as possible and bringing the remaining excess food to where it is needed most. The data of when food waste occurs is used in our analysis of what types of food waste could be avoided, and RLC suggests ways that partner food providers can reduce waste at its root.", "title": "Volunteer with One Brick and Rescuing Leftover Cuisine - Food for the Needy", "zipcode": "10018", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D3270855%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "ONE BRICK"}, {"end": "2020-12-05", "description": "Teen Arts Program Portfolio Mentorship Program Free Arts NYC empowers underserved youth through art and mentoring programs to develop their creativity, confidence, and skills to succeed.

Feel free to also check us out on our website to learn more about us at www.TEACH4Kids.org Who We Are: TEACH (Together Educating All Children in Hospitals) is an international not-for-profit organization that brings exciting, hands-on, STEM educational programming to children in hospitals. Our mission is to create an outlet for children of all ages to passionately engage with the sciences through the medium of fun, interactive experiments. Through engagement with practical science concepts, the children are challenged yet empowered. They emerge comforted and confident, encouraged to successfully cope with the trials that lie before them. TEACH modules challenge children to think creatively and bring an element of fun to an otherwise monotonous day. When TEACH volunteers visit, children get excited and get to experience STEM topics through more than 75 different interactive modules. Patients can learn about real life concepts while also having an exceptional amount of fun. They are amazed as they create silly putty while they learn about polymers and use basic engineering principles to build boats that really float. Observing the science of physiological respiration using yeast to inflate a balloon or discovering density by creating their very own lava lamps truly changes the way they view science, their stay in the hospital and life. What makes us special is that TEACH was founded by and is entirely run by students. In Spring 2013, TEACH&rsquo;s two co-founders were inspired to help with the need for interaction and activity, the craving for a personal bond, and the lack of mental and physical stimulation exhibited by hospitalized children. Under the mentorship and guidance of Dr. Edward Burns of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, TEACH was created to heal through teaching. TEACH began with monthly modules in a local Bronx hospital. In just over a year, TEACH grew to reach nine hospitals with hundreds of students signed up to volunteer from various universities around the tristate area. We have served over 3000 children, 30 hospitals internationally, and 1000 volunteers. What TEACH Needs TEACH is seeking an enthusiastic and passionate individual that wants to make a difference in the lives of medically ill children. We need someone who is committed to the organization both in the time they commit to as well as a financial responsibility to support the organization. Our Advisory board members are required to be active within the organization and play a significant role in the growth of the organization. Advisory Board Member Responsibilities TEACH Advisory board will meet periodically and communicates via email and phone at various times throughout the year. Advisory Board members are required to assist fundraising efforts and participate in at least one committee. Some of the things that they would need to participate in would be to promote events, participate in peer to peer campaigns, help with corporate partnerships and networking.

WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW: Kitchen dress code is very important to ensure the safety of our volunteers as well as preserve the quality of the food.

Hair must be completely covered, including ponytails and bangs. Hairnets are provided, though you are welcome to bring a hat. No bracelets, watches or dangly earrings can be worn.

Grace Healthcare Services is a Hospice organization that cares for patients throughout NJ. Veterans at the end of life. Volunteers are an essential component of this care. WHY A NEED FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS? -Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect to patients who have served our country. -Veterans share a common bond and code of conduct. -The camaraderie that exists between Veterans has proven to be a great support for the Veterans we care for. As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee.

Sprout is a non-profit organization based in New York City focused on providing innovative programs for adults with developmental disabilities.With our network of resources and dedicated volunteers, which we call leaders, Sprout opens up fascinating new worlds to people with disabilities. Sprout's Overnight Vacations Program is looking for individuals who have the energy, motivation and desire to work with adults with developmental disabilities. What do Sprout leaders do? Sprout leaders' primary goal is to give adults with developmental disabilities the opportunity to experience and enjoy recreational, educational and leisure activities through overnight vacations. Leaders are responsible for the overall safety and enjoyment of their group, 24 hours a day, while on a Sprout trip. Duties include safety monitoring, personal hygiene assistance, providing physical and emotional support, activity planning, budgeting, logistics, and enhancing fun. The work is hard yet immensely rewarding as you develop leadership skills and gain insight into your own abilities. What type of training is provided? Leaders must complete a pre-service training, which provides the necessary procedures and tools to run a successful and enjoyable vacation. Leaders who are drivers receive extra training on how to safely drive our 15-passenger vans. In addition, all leaders receive a copy of Sprout's Leadership Handbook to help with policies and guidelines. What is the time commitment? Sprout vacations last 3 - 7 days depending on the time of year and destination of the trip. When a leader is selected for an overnight vacation, Sprout asks that the leader dedicate themselves to stay with their group throughout the entire duration of the vacation. Some leaders only choose to lead one trip a year while others spend several months with us leading up to 8 trips or more. Sprout strives to make our program flexible for our leaders based on the amount of time leaders can give. Do leaders have any free or personal time while on a trip? Sprout trips are working vacations for the leaders who choose to participate. Because Sprout leaders are responsible for their group 24 hours a day, there is no free or personal time allotted. In order to give our participants the opportunity to experience and enjoy a vacation, Sprout leaders must be available at all times to provide the support any one participant may need. What type of trips can Sprout leaders expect to join? A majority of Sprout trips take place within a day's drive of New York City. Destinations include Atlantic City, Amish Country, Boston, Lake George, Cleveland, Maine and Virginia Beach. Exotic trips like cruises, Hawaii, and Europe are presented to leaders who have demonstrated high levels of commitment, service hours and have gained positive feedback from participants and Sprout office staff. Are there any special skills or requirements? No special background or education is required to become a Sprout leader. We encourage people from all cultures and professions, and of all ethnic and educational backgrounds. Once accepted into the program, you will receive the necessary tools to sign up for outings and how to assist our participants. Requirements include: -21+ years old -Provide references -Participate in training session -Willingness to complete necessary background checks -Evaluate participants' behavior -Fluent English -Willing to drive a 15 passenger van -Love to travel & have fun!

It is with this mission that we recognized the opportunity over 16 years ago to start a Free Tax Prep Program program for the underserved Brooklyn residents. NYC Free Tax Prep sites are operated by community-based organizations in partnership with the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DWCP). As Brooklyn&rsquo;s largest noncommercial tax provider, we have grown to cover most of central Brooklyn along with southern Brooklyn. This is, in large part, thanks to our volunteer tax preparers. Volunteer Tax Preparers will be tasked with completing high quality tax returns for low- and middle-income Brooklynites. Our ideal tax preparer would have a high interest and motivation for building on their tax preparation experience. They should also have a passion for helping the members of our community who need it most. Most of all, our volunteers should be able to practice patience, good customer service skills, and have a great sense of humor! This is a great opportunity to build valuable work experience, meet new friends, and help people who need it. Benefits Wide ranging benefits include learning new skills or building on valuable professional experience with active work duties. We have served as professional references for many of our volunteers. CPAs, Attorneys, and Enrolled Agents also receive Continuing Education Credits upon completion of volunteer service in this program. Build a sense of achievement for directly positively affecting your fellow Brooklynites by providing them with top quality tax service without the predatory service fees associated with retail tax providers. If that isn&rsquo;t enough for you to sign up, we&rsquo;ll also provide snacks. General Requirements All volunteers are welcome! If you don't have any tax experience, no problem! We provide training. Training All tax preparers must pass the IRS Volunteer Basic Certification via the Link and Learn training module online. Advanced Certification is also welcome. Upon completion of Link and Learn, volunteers would then be provided hands on training session to prepare them for the tax season. *FreeTaxPrep VolunteerTaxPrep", "title": "One of the Most Direct Ways to Help - Prepare Tax Returns!", "zipcode": "11237", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D2789915%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "Grow Brooklyn, Inc."}], "11701": [{"end": "2020-04-04", "description": "NBC AND STOP & SHOP PRESENT FEEDING OUR FAMILIES FOOD DRIVE Over 300 Stop & Shop stores from the Jersey Shore through Boston will be hosting one of the largest food drives in the Northeast and WE NEED YOUR HELP!

Girl Scouts are more successful in school, relationships, and careers; and they achieve more for their families, their community, and their country than non-Girl Scouts.

What&rsquo;s the leader's role? With the help of a strong support team and useful materials, a leader holds meetings for their troop of girls. Meetings are an hour or two, and usually consist of skill-building and badge earning activities. Leaders also communicate with troop parents and their local Girl Scout support team for any help they might need. How much time will this take? It's up to you! You decide how many times your troop meets. The time you give as a troop leader is valuable to us, and we'll give you tools that let you make the most of it.

CASA was created to make sure the abuse and neglect these children originally suffered at home doesn't continue as abuse and neglect at the hands of the system. As trained advocates, CASA volunteers are appointed by judges to be a voice for these children in court. The result is that a child is placed into a safe, loving home where he/she can thrive. CASA of Union County is currently recruiting for our Spring 2017 class of volunteer advocates. These volunteers will receive intensive training to equip them with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate their way through the court and child welfare systems. They will learn how to advocate for the best interest of children and make sure that the children receive the services and assistance necessary to ensure that they move as quickly as possible toward safe and permanent homes. Please note: No legal or social service experience is required, but you must be 21 years of age. The CASA training is approximately thirty hours, and the volunteer is required to make an eighteen month commitment. By law, volunteers must have a full criminal background check and fingerprint check, as well as a screening interview before beginning training. We are especially in need of bilingual - particularly Spanish-speaking - volunteers. Information about upcoming info sessions and the training schedule are available on our website: www.casaofunioncounty.org.

Nearly 70 percent of those placed in solitary had a mental health disorder, with nearly 37% having two or more diagnoses. \uf0b7 Youth suffer abuse while in adult prison: once incarcerated in an adult prison, one in four youth surveyed reported physical abuse; 5% reported sexual abuse.

Each year, the Guide Dog Foundation breeds about 300 exceptional puppies, and it's vital that Bosley and other pups like him spend the first year of their lives with surrounded by the love and security of volunteer foster families called puppy walkers. Puppy walkers help Foundation puppies grow up to be confident dogs. What's involved in raising a Guide Dog Foundation puppy? Bosley went to live with his puppy walkers when he was about nine weeks old. He's learning basic obedience and social skills while being exposed to many different situations. People who raise Guide Dog Foundation puppies say it is the most rewarding thing they've ever done. Puppy raisers come from everywhere - stay-at-home moms or dads, teachers, college students, retirees, people with flexible work environments - and are crucial members of the Guide Dog Foundation family. By opening their hearts and homes to a puppy, a puppy raiser plays a crucial role in helping a person with disabilities live an independent life. Every puppy walker family works with a Guide Dog Foundation puppy adviser, who is available to answer questions and offer guidance and support. When he is about 14 months old, Bosley will return to the Guide Dog Foundation's Smithtown campus to begin his training as a guide or service dog. Puppy raisers will admit it's tough to say good-bye, but when they see the pup they raised take its place at the side of someone with disabilities, the ache they feel turns pride.

Volunteers at Brooklyn Historical Society (BHS) offer valuable assistance to staff, visitors, and the public in a variety of ways.

BHS welcomes volunteers who have a sincere desire to lend their time and their skills to the institution. Volunteer opportunities are subject to availability and applicant&rsquo;s qualifications. Brooklyn Historical Society (BHS) is pleased to announce An Opening, an audio and visual installation by Brooklyn-based artist Kameelah Janan Rasheed, who is known for her immersive large-scale installations, text-based art work, publications, and audio recordings. Rasheed draws on BHS&rsquo;s Muslims in Brooklyn oral histories to create a unique audio and visual experience that challenges narrow conceptions of Muslim identity and history. The installation and oral histories are part of Muslims in Brooklyn, a public arts and history project launched by BHS in 2017 to preserve and amplify stories of Brooklyn&rsquo;s diverse Muslim communities. An Opening invites visitors to experience these conversations both visually and aurally as they explore an ecosystem of sound and art that moves beyond linear narrative, fixed categories, and static identities. Visitors to the exhibition are outfitted with an iPod Touch and headphones. As they move around the room, they hear sounds of speech and snippets of stories, as if encountering conversations in a crowded room. As they stand facing each new work of art in the gallery, the iPod Touch plays an audio piece, selected by the artist, to accompany the image. Rasheed has created a non-linear and fluid experience determined entirely by the body&rsquo;s movement and positioning, offering each visitor a chance to direct their own individual experience. BHS is seeking volunteers to help support the visitor experience of An Opening.

Grace Healthcare Services is a Hospice organization that cares for patients throughout NJ. Veterans at the end of life. Volunteers are an essential component of this care. WHY A NEED FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS? -Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect to patients who have served our country. -Veterans share a common bond and code of conduct. -The camaraderie that exists between Veterans has proven to be a great support for the Veterans we care for. As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee. Please help us honor our Veterans by giving them the gift of your time. If you are interested or have questions please contact the Grace Healthcare Services Volunteer Department at 732-225-4100 ext. 138 to inquire about the Veteran-to-Veteran Volunteer Program.

Grace Healthcare Services is a Hospice organization that cares for patients throughout NJ. Veterans at the end of life. Volunteers are an essential component of this care. WHY A NEED FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS? -Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect to patients who have served our country. -Veterans share a common bond and code of conduct. -The camaraderie that exists between Veterans has proven to be a great support for the Veterans we care for. As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee. Please help us honor our Veterans by giving them the gift of your time.

This fall, nXu is launching a selective, 1-year, out-of-school fellowship program in San Antonio, Seattle, and New York City. The program brings together ~30 10th graders from a range of district, charter, private and parochial schools to form an intentionally diverse cohort that bridges race, gender, and class lines. During the school year, nXu Fellows gather twice per month for immersive sessions led by our Lead Compass Coach and a team of volunteer Compass Coaches. What is the volunteer opportunity? We are looking for passionate volunteer Compass Coaches who are excited to lead 10th grade nXu Fellows through this year-long Purpose Exploration journey. Using our curriculum, each volunteer Compass Coach will guide their Compass Team (~8 participants) through a series of pre-scripted and planned immersive activities, conversations, exercises, and reflections. With support from Compass Coaches, Fellows will form valuable bonds and expand their self-knowledge. We are looking for volunteer Compass Coaches who: Represent a range of identity markers and professional experiences. Show an interest in exploring their own self-development. Are eager to share their personal and professional wisdom and experiences. Are intellectually curious, vulnerable, and ready to have a good time. Are excited to be trained in providing an inclusive and engaging experience for students. Demonstrate excellent interpersonal and communication skills and are capable of delivering pre-scripted content. Want to guide nXu participants to reach their desired life purpose goals and help them reflect on various experiences. What is the time commitment?

Volunteer Compass Coaches will receive pre-scripted session plans in order to successfully execute our curriculum. nXu sessions are designed so that everyone who participates-including Compass Coaches-has the opportunity to learn from our curriculum. During each immersive session, the Lead Compass Coach (head facilitator) will set the tone and orient the nXu Fellows to the day&rsquo;s learning objectives. With support from the Lead Compass Coach, volunteer Compass Coaches will guide the nXu Fellows through the day and support them in learning the session&rsquo;s objective through a series of engaging activities/practices, reflections, and authentic conversations. Volunteer Compass Coaches will build a culture of curiosity and vulnerability, ask questions, lead discussions, share their own experiences, and actively engage in the day&rsquo;s activities with the Fellows.

Here is an opportunity to help underprivileged children, to help under-served children, to help ALL children, and even to help adults who can't read. We are looking for three, very special people, who have the skills, expertise, experience, passion, and time to be part of something amazing that is about to fundamentally change the lives of millions of children. Right now, millions of children have no hope; but soon, they will have the opportunity to learn how to read, which, in turn, will open a window to education and to a world of potential for them that, not only, has never been opened before, but that has never even been seriously contemplated as a potential reality. What we are talking about is an adaptive learning, smartphone app, that can literally, teach a child to read in and average of just 12 hours of total use time! We are the American Youth Literacy Foundation, and we have been teaching children how to read for 11 years! We have been developing this app for about two years, and this year we will launch this incredible smartphone app in the App Store and on Google Play by Thanksgiving, 2020! We are partnered with an engineering team that was one of the five $1 million finalists in the XPrize for Global Learning competition (the winners of which were announced this past May), which was a worldwide competition for app \\\"design and development\\\" teams from around the world to design, build and deliver a tablet-based app to children in remote villages in Africa which could teach them how to read and do basic math (children of all ages, most of whom had never been to school before in their lives). The curriculum that our app is based on is a patented reading decoding system, and is so effective at teaching children how to read, that it usually only takes 4-6 hours for them to understand the basic learning tools, and another 4-6 hours for them to reach a 2nd grade reading level. Compare this to so many of our students who have been in the public school system for 6 years and still can't spell the word \\\"the.\\\" Compare this to millions of students who have dropped out of school, primarily because they can't read (more than 10 million per decade). More than 20 million children in grades 3-12 in America's public schools today can't read! Our organization is an 11 year old, nationwide, charitable 501 c 3 non-profit. We started out as a tutoring program and we still provide one-on-one tutoring. But our focus has always been on finding a scaleable solution to the literacy crisis in America. With the rise of the smartphone and the amazing penetration of this powerful tool (currently estimated at 80%), even into the most impoverished communities, we feel that the answer we have been searching for IS in the form of an app. So for the past several years we have been working to convert our amazing reading curriculum, that teaches children how to read in an average of just 12 hours, into an app that teaches children how to read in about the same time. And this is where you come in. We have a LOT of opportunity in front of us to finish building and testing, and, ultimately, to deliver an end-user experience (the UX) to millions of children in America's inner cities and rural counties, in the barrios and the suburbs, and on the American Indian reservations, and everywhere in-between, with this smartphone app. But in order to do this, we need to complete three pieces of the equation: The Horse, The Cart, and the Payload. The Horse is the curriculum; and it is well under way in the conversion process from an analog to a digital curriculum. The Cart is the distribution system, the \\\"how do we get it out into communities and to the children, once it's built?\\\" Despite what some may think, just because we put an app in the App Store, doesn't mean it will go viral. There's an old adage that goes, \\\"build a better mousetrap, and the world will NOT beat a path to your door!\\\" You still have to market, publicize and distribute your invention, even if it's FREE, like ours! And the Payload is the UX (the user experience). But it's not just the child (the ultimate beneficiary) who must enjoy the experience enough to continue through the progressive learning modules, it's also the parent, or guardian, or friend, or grandparent, or sibling, or concerned adult, who must be supported. And for that we are building the support system and the support network that will scale with the app, and not constrain the growth and penetration of the app into the interstitial spaces of American society. The UX must be tested and must be proven to work in a controlled environment before it is released into an uncontrolled environment like the App Store or Google Play, where its success will depend upon ease of use, ease of understanding and the support that we provide to caring adults who download the app for the purpose of saving their child from living a life of impoverishment, without education, and without hope. That support network for caring adults will consist of in-app information as well as web-based content that they can refer to to gain a better understanding of what the app is and how it works and how they can best assist their child through the learning process. In addition, all of our external communications will be supported and cross connected through our website. Our brand, image, content and messaging will be a collaboration of our graphic design, UX, communications and web mastery teams. The specific software we use to update and improve our website will be decided after we have assessed all of the new component parts we wish to include in our web presence. As for the curriculum, we have approximately 1,500 of 2,000 screens completed. After the child learns the fundamentals of letters and sounds and how to blend sound symbols to form words and sentences, we transition them to English where we utilize our patented diacritic decoding system to introduce them to the irregular letter patterns we use in English spelling. From there we continue to increase their awareness of the various letter patterns and combinations while simultaneously introducing them to more and more complex sentences and stories and interactive, fiction and non-fiction content. Our Curriculum Management Team will be helping to manage all 2,000 screens of the app as they continue through development and beta testing, design and engineering. The screens are organized into approximately 40 modules of 50 screens each. All of these modules are named using a comprehensive naming convention that identifies the location and content as well as the category of learning and narration, level of difficulty and other identifiers. As changes and additions are made, they will be organizing and updating the master spreadsheet containing all of the curriculum data. Even minor changes can require updates to numerous spreadsheet cells that contain interdependent data. Our stated goal at the American Youth Literacy Foundation, and the purpose of the FUNetix Literacy App is to teach children HOW to read, to make them \\\"lifelong readers,\\\" to free them from a life of illiteracy, to insure that they will NEVER fall back into illiteracy, and to show them that they can LEARN ANYTHING if they step through the portal of reading! And we do ALL of this in about 12 hours of total instruction time. There's much more to tell. You can read more about our story and about us on our current website at www.YouthLit.org. But right now, we are looking for 3 very special people who have everything we mentioned above, passion, expertise, time, etc. to join our team and help us launch this app in 2020. Our three Curriculum Management Team Leads will help catalog the final 500 screens of the app as they come online, and update, improve, organize and manipulate the first 1,500 screens as we approach launch date. This effort will require deep collaboration with the other team members mentioned above and will require strong spreadsheet skills including graphing, cell formulas, organizational skills, excellent planning and communications skills and strong attention to detail. If you wish to be considered for this opportunity to be one of the three leads for our Curriculum Management Team, please send us a cover letter and resume to info@YouthLit.org. We are looking for intelligent, creative, enthusiastic, cheerful, optimistic individuals with significant spreadsheet management experience. This is a complex undertaking and we are looking for highly proficient and organized professionals. Just to be clear, our organization is an all volunteer, mission-centric, extended virtual network, comprised of highly skilled and experienced individuals from around the country (and a few from around the world) who collaborate through cloud-based technology and platforms.

They report to the court, raising issues of concern that may interfere with a child's best interests and providing information that will help the judge make an informed decision. Volunteer Advocates can also play a pivotal role in assuring that a child or family is receiving services the court has ordered, such as physical or mental health services, substance abuse counseling or special education. During the life of a case, Volunteer Advocates monitor the child's situation to assure he or she remains safe and may be the only constant in the child's life as he or she moves through the bureaucratic maze of the child welfare system. Volunteers come from all backgrounds and need not have experience in legal or social services. The only requirement is a strong desire to help children who are in dire need of help. A note on volunteer commitment: Volunteer Advocates complete a one-time 30-hour pre-service training and commit to serve for a minimum of one year after case assignment or until an assigned case is closed. In addition to dedicating at least 3-5 hours, more if necessary, each week on each case assigned, volunteers attend monthly group supervisions and in-service trainings.

In Bigs & Littles NYC&rsquo;s keystone mentoring program, youth ages 7-19, are carefully matched with a Big Sister or Big Brother who serves as an adviser, role model, and adult friend. Mentoring matches meet twice monthly for activities such as enjoying a show or ballgame, working together on a service project, or spending time talking and exploring NYC. Matches are supported by life skills programming, crisis intervention, family support, and referral assistance as well as a dedicated Professional Program Manager to oversee and guide the match relationship. This mentoring model has been the core of Bigs & Littles NYC Mentoring mission for over a century. Our goal is for all young people to be empowered to recognize, reach for and achieve their full potential. We know the program works: 100% of our kids avoid pregnancy, 100% avoid arrest, 93% are promoted to the next grade, 100% graduate High School and 100% matriculate into college or a training program. A Match is... The relationship between a Big (volunteer mentor) and a Little (mentee) Bigs serve as positive role models and friends who help Littles set and accomplish goals Bigs and Littles plan and participate in fun activities together which form a lasting impact for both individuals Supported by a Match Coordinator (Masters level social worker or equivalent) at the agency Bigs are ... 21 years old or older Interested in mentoring a Little of the same gender, age 7-17, who lives in the five boroughs Willing and able to finance match outings (low or no-cost outings are highly encouraged) Willing to pick up / drop off Little for outings if the Little doesn&rsquo;t travel independently From all walks of life! Men, people of color, volunteers ages 50+, individuals of all faith backgrounds, and Spanish speakers highly encouraged to apply Big and Little matches connect... Over time: Bigs and Littles each commit to the match relationship for at least one year Face-to-face: twice per month for about eight total hours (usually on the weekends) Over the phone: once weekly to catch up To learn skills: workshops are offered throughout the year at the Bigs & Littles NYC office for hands-on match support and skill-building Interested?

As a tutor, you will collaborate with a local coordinator to improve students&rsquo; performance while being supported and guided by experienced academic support professionals. To apply, you must: 1. Have received an A- or A in the introduction to the subject course you are applying to tutor. 2. Have a GPA at or above 3.2, or have received a degree recently. 3. Be willing to complete 11.5 hours of College Reading and Learning Aligned (CRLA) training at City College of New York. All tutors are also expected to complete a four session comprehensive, professional training regimen. 6 hours of live training, plus another hour and a half for orientation. This is a commitment of 7.5 hours of in person training, and 4 hours of supplemental training for a total of 11.5 hours of training over the course of the Spring semester. We can accommodate your schedule for the live trainings. CT's tutoring program has been successful in helping students gain access to support that they otherwise would not have received, given their limited time spent on campus. Having tutors in these sessions early in the semester will allow us to employ strategies to reduce withdrawals and student failure rates.

For Goodness Cakes works with foster agencies and care homes to match volunteers to bake and deliver birthday cakes to disadvantaged youth and young adults in many locations across the US. We are looking for volunteer bakers to join our Sprinkle Squad of intrepid bakers to help put smiles on a child&rsquo;s face. The opportunity is flexible around your schedule, whether you can commit to one cake a year or fifty. You don&rsquo;t have to be a master cake decorator to help out, even a simple cake can make the day sweet! These children and young adult's lives when we connect with them are centered around fixing their immediate traumas - be it neglect, poverty, or abandonment. For Goodness Cakes presents a unique opportunity to help give them the chance to disconnect from that trauma, and give hope in the world around them. It produces such an incredible impact from a small effort that almost anyone can join and give back around their own busy schedules. Check out our website at the link below to take our online orientation and begin baking cakes! This training is mandatory for all volunteers, and there are zero exceptions. You'll learn about how we work, what to expect from your volunteer experience, and all about food safety - because that's our number one priority! When you become a volunteer you'll be baking out of your own home, choosing cakes to bake and deliver around your own schedule, so it's imperative you understand the risks and liabilities. Keep in mind that you must be at least 18 years old, are able to make deliveries in the County you provide, and you must pass with a 90% or more within two attempts.

Worker will be trained extensively on procedures and methods. Must be open to working with all types of wild mammals and reptiles native to NJ. Worker can work with species that are considered rabies vector species (such as raccoons) only if they have had preemptive rabies vaccination series and viable titer (can be requested through your doctor or through the ER if you say you work with wild animals). Workers will be required to declare a day or days and times they can work - and must stick to that schedule unless they find a sub. Shifts typically start at 8am, noon, 4pm and 8pm in the spring season when baby animals arrive (although the shifts may begin earlier this year). Additionally, when animals are ready to be released back into the wild, workers have the option of going out on the releases. NJ requires those who work directly with wildlife be at least 16 years of age, although you can work around wildlife if you are younger. Internships are available for college students.

Here is an opportunity to help underprivileged children, to help under-served children, to help ALL children, and even to help adults who can't read. We are looking for three, very special people, who have the skills, expertise, experience, passion, and time to be part of something amazing that is about to fundamentally change the lives of millions of children. Right now, millions of children have no hope; but soon, they will have the opportunity to learn how to read, which, in turn, will open a window to education and to a world of potential for them that, not only, has never been opened before, but that has never even been seriously contemplated as a potential reality. What we are talking about is an adaptive learning, smartphone app, that can literally, teach a child to read in and average of just 12 hours of total use time! We are the American Youth Literacy Foundation, and we have been teaching children how to read for 11 years! We have been developing this app for about two years, and this year we will launch this incredible smartphone app in the App Store and on Google Play by Thanksgiving, 2020! We are partnered with an engineering team that was one of the five $1 million finalists in the XPrize for Global Learning competition (the winners of which were announced this past May), which was a worldwide competition for app \\\"design and development\\\" teams from around the world to design, build and deliver a tablet-based app to children in remote villages in Africa which could teach them how to read and do basic math (children of all ages, most of whom had never been to school before in their lives). The curriculum that our app is based on is a patented reading decoding system, and is so effective at teaching children how to read, that it usually only takes 4-6 hours for them to understand the basic learning tools, and another 4-6 hours for them to reach a 2nd grade reading level. Compare this to so many of our students who have been in the public school system for 6 years and still can't spell the word \\\"the.\\\" Compare this to millions of students who have dropped out of school, primarily because they can't read (more than 10 million per decade). More than 20 million children in grades 3-12 in America's public schools today can't read! Our organization is an 11 year old, nationwide, charitable 501 c 3 non-profit. We started out as a tutoring program and we still provide one-on-one tutoring. But our focus has always been on finding a scaleable solution to the literacy crisis in America. With the rise of the smartphone and the amazing penetration of this powerful tool (currently estimated at 80%), even into the most impoverished communities, we feel that the answer we have been searching for IS in the form of an app. So for the past several years we have been working to convert our amazing reading curriculum, that teaches children how to read in an average of just 12 hours, into an app that teaches children how to read in about the same time. And this is where you come in. We have a LOT of opportunity in front of us to finish building and testing, and, ultimately, to deliver an end-user experience (the UX) to millions of children in America's inner cities and rural counties, in the barrios and the suburbs, and on the American Indian reservations, and everywhere in-between, with this smartphone app. But in order to do this, we need to complete three pieces of the equation: The Horse, The Cart, and the Payload. The Horse is the curriculum; and it is well under way in the conversion process from an analog to a digital curriculum. The Cart is the distribution system, the \\\"how do we get it out into communities and to the children, once it's built?\\\" Despite what some may think, just because we put an app in the App Store, doesn't mean it will go viral. There's an old adage that goes, \\\"build a better mousetrap, and the world will NOT beat a path to your door!\\\" You still have to market, publicize and distribute your invention, even if it's FREE, like ours! And the Payload is the UX (the user experience). But it's not just the child (the ultimate beneficiary) who must enjoy the experience enough to continue through the progressive learning modules, it's also the parent, or guardian, or friend, or grandparent, or sibling, or concerned adult, who must be supported. And for that we are building the support system and the support network that will scale with the app, and not constrain the growth and penetration of the app into the interstitial spaces of American society. The UX must be tested and must be proven to work in a controlled environment before it is released into an uncontrolled environment like the App Store or Google Play, where its success will depend upon ease of use, ease of understanding and the support that we provide to caring adults who download the app for the purpose of saving their child from living a life of impoverishment, without education, and without hope. That support network for caring adults will consist of in-app information as well as web-based content that they can refer to to gain a better understanding of what the app is and how it works and how they can best assist their child through the learning process. In addition, all of our external communications will be supported and cross connected through our website. Our brand, image, content and messaging will be a collaboration of our graphic design, UX, communications and web mastery teams. The specific software we use to update and improve our website will be decided after we have assessed all of the new component parts we wish to include in our web presence. As for the curriculum, we have approximately 1,500 of 2,000 screens completed. After the child learns the fundamentals of letters and sounds and how to blend sound symbols to form words and sentences, we transition them to English where we utilize our patented diacritic decoding system to introduce them to the irregular letter patterns we use in English spelling. From there we continue to increase their awareness of the various letter patterns and combinations while simultaneously introducing them to more and more complex sentences and stories and interactive, fiction and non-fiction content. Our Curriculum Management Team will be helping to manage all 2,000 screens of the app as they continue through development and beta testing, design and engineering. The screens are organized into approximately 40 modules of 50 screens each. All of these modules are named using a comprehensive naming convention that identifies the location and content as well as the category of learning and narration, level of difficulty and other identifiers. As changes and additions are made, they will be organizing and updating the master spreadsheet containing all of the curriculum data. Even minor changes can require updates to numerous spreadsheet cells that contain interdependent data. Our stated goal at the American Youth Literacy Foundation, and the purpose of the FUNetix Literacy App is to teach children HOW to read, to make them \\\"lifelong readers,\\\" to free them from a life of illiteracy, to insure that they will NEVER fall back into illiteracy, and to show them that they can LEARN ANYTHING if they step through the portal of reading! And we do ALL of this in about 12 hours of total instruction time. There's much more to tell. You can read more about our story and about us on our current website at www.YouthLit.org. But right now, we are looking for 3 very special people who have everything we mentioned above, passion, expertise, time, etc. to join our team and help us launch this app in 2020. Our three Curriculum Management Team Leads will help catalog the final 500 screens of the app as they come online, and update, improve, organize and manipulate the first 1,500 screens as we approach launch date. This effort will require deep collaboration with the other team members mentioned above and will require strong spreadsheet skills including graphing, cell formulas, organizational skills, excellent planning and communications skills and strong attention to detail. If you wish to be considered for this opportunity to be one of the three leads for our Curriculum Management Team, please send us a cover letter and resume to info@YouthLit.org. We are looking for intelligent, creative, enthusiastic, cheerful, optimistic individuals with significant spreadsheet management experience. This is a complex undertaking and we are looking for highly proficient and organized professionals. Just to be clear, our organization is an all volunteer, mission-centric, extended virtual network, comprised of highly skilled and experienced individuals from around the country (and a few from around the world) who collaborate through cloud-based technology and platforms. Individuals interested in this position must have the confidence and ability to work in a virtual environment using select networking and communications tools and platforms. Thank you! We hope this opportunity finds you at the right place and the right time in your career to make a difference and an impact, in an amazing way, for millions of children who are waiting for someone, or some thing, to lead them out of a life of impoverishment and into a future of unlimited possibility and potential.

Guiding Principles As a board member, I understand that I owe duties of care, loyalty, and obedience to the organization and the children it serves. The duty of care is the duty to monitor Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s activities, see that its mission is being accomplished, and guard its financial resources. The duty of loyalty is the duty to avoid conflicts of interest. The duty of obedience is to be faithful to Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s mission and to comply with the law. I will uphold these duties and do my utmost to ensure that Maya&rsquo;s Hope performs its mission and achieves its goals. Principal Commitments Act with integrity and represent the interests of all people served by the organization. Recognize that decisions of the board can be made only by a majority vote at a) a board meeting or b) in writing. Respect the majority decisions of the board. Participate in: Board self-evaluation programs. Board development workshops, seminars, and other educational events that enhance skills as a board member. Handle information with discretion and confidentiality as necessary. Exercise authority as a board member only when acting in a meeting with the full board or as delegated by the board with members. Collaborate with members who serve this board and leave personal prejudices out of all board discussions. Represent Maya&rsquo;s Hope in a positive and supportive manner at all times. Display courteous conduct at all board and committee meetings. Refrain from intruding on administrative issues that are the responsibility of management, except to monitor the results of the organization. Monitor the financial condition of the organization. Understand and comply with the bylaws of Maya&rsquo;s Hope. Avoid conflicts of interest between my position as a board member and my personal or professional life (as referenced in Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s Conflict of Interest Policy.) If such a conflict does arise, I will disclose that conflict to the board and refrain from voting on matters in which I have conflict. Liability of Board Members As a fully incorporated non-profit, Maya&rsquo;s Hope enjoys the same limited liability that any corporation does. Corporations offer the protection of limited liability to corporate directors and officers. Limited liability means that the organization's directors and officers have limited personal liability for business debts. Generally, creditors can only go after corporate assets and insurance to satisfy liabilities incurred by the corporation. This principle applies, however, only when the board has fulfilled its basic duties, such as the duty of care. A board member is legally bound to exercise reasonable care when he or she makes a decision for the organization. Reasonable care is what an 'ordinarily prudent' person in a similar situation would do. Examples of when a board member may have personal liability include (but are not limited to) when a board member: personally and directly injures someone. personally guarantees a bank loan or a business debt on which the corporation defaults, or behaves in a fraudulent or illegal manner that causes harm, Maya&rsquo;s Hope maintains a Directors & Officers liability insurance policy. Responsibilities of Secretary: Meeting Minutes The primary task of the secretary of an executive board is to record and maintain the minutes of each board meeting. Meeting minutes are detail reports that highlight the predetermined agenda of each conference as well as what actually took place. For example, a secretary may notate the following: \\\"The meeting began at 11 a.m. The first order of business was for the president to discuss potential changes to the organization&rsquo;s mission statement; however, he was unable to attend the gathering due to medical reasons. The issue was put on hold until a later date.\\\" Record Maintenance As the custodian of corporate records, the secretary of an executive board must maintain all company files in a manner compliant with organizational policies as well as any laws that regulate the industry. These documents may include the firm&rsquo;s article of incorporation, bylaws and employee contact lists, as well as financial records. He must also develop and enforce policies regarding access to these confidential files. Security controls, such as who can access which files and what approvals are needed to do so, are examples of the many procedures he must implement. Depending on the industry in which the company does business, the secretary of the executive board may be required to file certain documents with the government. For example, a nonprofit organization must meet certain criteria to maintain its tax-exempt status. It is often the responsibility of the secretary to ensure that all necessary paperwork is completed and returned to the Internal Revenue Service. Organizational Representative It is not uncommon for the secretary of an executive board to serve as its signing officer. This designation gives her the authority to sign documents, such as contracts, checks and credit applications, on behalf of the organization. Because this responsibility wields so much power, many firms implement a system of checks and balances so it is not abused. For instance, before signing a service agreement, the secretary may need the express written permission of two other board members. She must follow these guidelines or risk termination and, in severe cases, criminal prosecution.", "title": "Board Member Opening at Maya's Hope", "zipcode": "10001", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D2862432%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "Maya's Hope"}, {"end": null, "description": "As a Seed Coach you will form a one-to-one advising relationship with a young woman of color to transform her passion and dreams into a powerful story for her resume and college essay.

Focus on Latino Charities or Your Other Favorite Cause At ChangingThePresent you can focus on Latino charities or any other favorite cause. We Channel New Funds to Nonprofits The New York Times called ChangingThePresent.org an \\\"amazon.com of the nonprofit world\\\" for our work in helping nonprofits capture some of the $450 billion Americans spend each year on birthday, wedding, and holiday presents. A growing number of people, who seek meaning more than things, are starting to show their love by donating in a friend&rsquo;s name in lieu of buying yet more \\\"stuff.\\\" The challenge for nonprofits is that it is simply too daunting to provide the requisite gift-like experience (tangible charitable gifts, wish lists and registries, and personalized printed greeting cards) that can make a donation feel like a rewarding gift. ChangingThePresent.org provides those tools to facilitate this type of giving for nonprofits and donors. We are about to take ChangingThePresent to the next level. That involves expanding from the initial 400 organizations to invite all 1.1 million nonprofits; adding additional causes and categories. Within each cause area, we will seek growth funding, invite advisors, recruit nonprofits, use media and social media to raise awareness among the public, and recruit celebrities to lend their voices. Imagine the impact we can make together as more and more people adopt this type of meaningful giving. The Work Environment This is a great place to work. We have had interns and volunteers from all over the United States and more than forty countries. The atmosphere is energetic, creative, and fun. We value brainstorming, initiative, sharing, and collaborating. Think of it is a laboratory, studio, seminar, or incubator. We are also casual. We are interested in your brains, creativity and heart, rather than your attire. Want to work in jeans, t-shirt and flip-flops? That&rsquo;s fine with us. Who, Where, When We are glad to hear from high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as professionals who want to make a meaningful impact with their skills.

A pioneering nonprofit, Heifer International, has shown that nonprofits can capture some of that money by making donations, given in a friend&rsquo;s name, feel like a present. It works! They raise $115 million a year this way. Imagine how much more gift money could be captured by nonprofits addressing popular causes, including your favorites. The challenge is that it is too daunting for most nonprofits to provide a gift-like experience: tangible donation opportunities, wish lists, gift registries, and personalized printed greeting cards. About www.ChangingThePresent.org Our nonprofit site provides a gift-like experience, which helps 400 leading nonprofits capture money normally spent on traditional presents. The NY Times called it an \\\"amazon.com of the nonprofit world.\\\" We are now about to invite all million nonprofits to join the site. We are also providing each with their own private, charitable gift sites so they can send supporters without exposing them to other nonprofits. See a sample: http://SampleNGO.GiftsForHumanity.org.

We offer four great benefits: Take on a leadership role Enhance your resume Make a difference Generate funds for college tuition and textbooks We are looking for passionate, energetic students with exceptional skills. This is an outstanding leadership opportunity in an innovative start-up nonprofit organization. About ClassWish ClassWish is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in NYC and working nationwide. Our initial focus was in providing resources for K-12 students. We are now turning attention to help generate funds for nonprofits and for college tuition and textbooks, as well. We offer high-achieving students unparalleled opportunities to assume responsibility, use their skills, gain experience, and make a difference--and provide relief from the cost of college tuition and textbooks. Here are the problems we are tackling: We are tackling two problems at once: Nonprofits need far more funding to fulfill their missions, and schools need far more resources for kids (books, computers, art supplies, musical instruments, science equipment, and sports equipment are all in desperately short supply). Students and their families are burdened by the skyrocketing cost of college tuition and textbooks. (By the way, be sure to see www.TuitionRevolution.org). Our Approach ClassWish is launching a new initiative to address these needs. Soon, students and their families will be able to earn an average of 8% of what they spend at stores, grocers, gas stations, restaurants, hotels, and airlines, and they will be able to direct that to their favorite schools, teachers, nonprofits, or even their own tuition and textbooks. What Campus Reps Will Do ClassWish Campus Reps will help raise awareness of this opportunity for students, professors, and their families to generate funding for schools, nonprofits, and college tuition. We will recruit a campus rep on each college campus. They, in turn, will recruit additional campus reps to focus on each of these areas: Greek life Residence halls Athletics Student government Student clubs and organizations Professors and administration Alumni Student media Social media Events Graphics Communications Marketing We Want to Hear From Outstanding Students Interested in becoming a Campus Rep? Send a brief cover letter and a resume to interns [AT] ClassWish.org. Looking for a great internship in NYC or virtually?

What You Will Do These NYC-based interns will lead the launch of the world&rsquo;s largest Virtual Community Service program. We expect to engage thousands of high school and college students in China to work online and raise awareness of ClassWish.org so that we can improve schools and education for American students. The ClassWish.org Virtual Community Service program gives Chinese students in China a unique opportunity to gain valuable experience, develop real-world skills, enhance their resumes, and greatly improve their chance for admission to American universities. One benefit that will be of special interest to the students in China is the opportunity to improve their resume with the addition of a responsible Community Service position that will help them gain admittance to American colleges. About ClassWish.org Here is the problem we are tackling: K-12 schools in this country do not have enough resources to let children explore their potential and excel. Books, computers, art supplies, musical instruments, science equipment, sports equipment, and even paper for computers and printers are all in desperately short supply. Our Approach: ClassWish.org, an exciting new nonprofit, uses modern business practices and the latest marketing techniques to help 125,000 schools serving 56 million kids, inform, inspire and engage supporters. Teachers visit the site to create Wish Lists of the resources they need. People in the community can see exactly what is needed and contribute to help. About Us: We have an innovative and capable team supported by professionals and celebrities. What You Will Get Out of the Experience You will enhance your resume with a solid record of professional achievement in building a very large and innovative new program, you will gain recognition for your community service, and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you have helped children get the tools they need to perform at their best.

FAQ - Review ClassWish.org&rsquo;s outstanding internship program here: Is this a business or a nonprofit? ClassWish is a nonprofit, but we use the latest techniques from the business world to make a leveraged, scalable and financially-self sustaining difference in the lives of tens of millions of children. This sounds ambitious! Daniel Burnham, the great Chicago architect, said \\\"Make no little plans; they have not the power to stir men&rsquo;s souls.\\\" (Nor women&rsquo;s, we hasten to add). Little plans also do not have the power to provide a better education to 56 million kids who deserve more than they are getting today. We face a crushing need in schools, have a solid plan to address it, and with your help, we intend to grow this very large and very fast. Where are you located? We are in Manhattan, conveniently located right across from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. Four express subway stops, LIRR, and the PATH train are all within one block. We also hire interns to work remotely from other cities. What skills and experience are you looking for? We seek a wide range of skills: graphic designers, videographers, writers, researchers, creative thinkers, analytical sorts, community organizers, social media stars, people with great communication skills, MBA students, and more. I looked at your site and have some suggestions. Great! This is a collaborative project, and we want to hear from you. Your ClassWish review will be helpful. Is this a paid internship? We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your rsum, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions. Do check to see if your school offers a stipend program. When will you select the interns? We&rsquo;re agile. When we see a great candidate, we extend an invitation immediately. We won&rsquo;t keep you waiting for a decision. What dates will the internship run? We are flexible. Tell us what you are looking for. What are the hours? We welcome full-time and part-time interns. Let us know what works for you. What will I need to bring? Brains, heart, passion, energy, a notebook computer (as an early-stage nonprofit, we just can&rsquo;t afford to buy dozens of machines), and a passion to make an immediate improvement to the education of tens of millions of children. Sounds exciting! How can I apply? Please send a short cover letter and an impressive resume to interns @ ClassWish . org.", "title": "Make a Difference.

You will enhance your resume with a solid record of professional achievement and community service, and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you have helped children get the tools they need to perform at their best.

When will you select the interns? We&rsquo;re agile. When we see a great candidate, we extend an invitation immediately. We won&rsquo;t keep you waiting for a decision.

The ability to read transforms lives and empowers children to reach their full potential. Research shows that when students can read at grade level by fourth grade, they have a greater opportunity to succeed in school and beyond. With your help, we can equip students with the foundational skills they need to read at grade level. Each week, you will meet with your student for a one-on-one tutoring session to help them develop strong literacy skills and discover a passion for reading. We'll provide a structured curriculum, in-person training, and ongoing support to help your student thrive. Rigorous research has proven that Reading Partners significantly increases reading proficiency. No teaching experience required and anyone over the age of 14 can volunteer.

Grace Healthcare Services is a Hospice organization that cares for patients throughout NJ. Veterans at the end of life. Volunteers are an essential component of this care. WHY A NEED FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS? -Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect to patients who have served our country. -Veterans share a common bond and code of conduct. -The camaraderie that exists between Veterans has proven to be a great support for the Veterans we care for. As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee. Please help us honor our Veterans by giving them the gift of your time.

Feel free to also check us out on our website to learn more about us at www.TEACH4Kids.org Who We Are: TEACH (Together Educating All Children in Hospitals) is an international not-for-profit organization that brings exciting, hands-on, STEM educational programming to children in hospitals. Our mission is to create an outlet for children of all ages to passionately engage with the sciences through the medium of fun, interactive experiments. Through engagement with practical science concepts, the children are challenged yet empowered. They emerge comforted and confident, encouraged to successfully cope with the trials that lie before them. TEACH modules challenge children to think creatively and bring an element of fun to an otherwise monotonous day. When TEACH volunteers visit, children get excited and get to experience STEM topics through more than 75 different interactive modules. Patients can learn about real life concepts while also having an exceptional amount of fun. They are amazed as they create silly putty while they learn about polymers and use basic engineering principles to build boats that really float. Observing the science of physiological respiration using yeast to inflate a balloon or discovering density by creating their very own lava lamps truly changes the way they view science, their stay in the hospital and life. What makes us special is that TEACH was founded by and is entirely run by students. In Spring 2013, TEACH&rsquo;s two co-founders were inspired to help with the need for interaction and activity, the craving for a personal bond, and the lack of mental and physical stimulation exhibited by hospitalized children. Under the mentorship and guidance of Dr. Edward Burns of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, TEACH was created to heal through teaching. TEACH began with monthly modules in a local Bronx hospital. In just over a year, TEACH grew to reach nine hospitals with hundreds of students signed up to volunteer from various universities around the tristate area. We have served over 3000 children, 30 hospitals internationally, and 1000 volunteers. What TEACH Needs TEACH is seeking an enthusiastic and passionate individual that wants to make a difference in the lives of medically ill children. We need someone who is committed to the organization both in the time they commit to as well as a financial responsibility to support the organization. Our Advisory board members are required to be active within the organization and play a significant role in the growth of the organization. Advisory Board Member Responsibilities TEACH Advisory board will meet periodically and communicates via email and phone at various times throughout the year. Advisory Board members are required to assist fundraising efforts and participate in at least one committee. Some of the things that they would need to participate in would be to promote events, participate in peer to peer campaigns, help with corporate partnerships and networking.
