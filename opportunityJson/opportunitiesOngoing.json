Here is an opportunity to help underprivileged children, to help under-served children, to help ALL children, and even to help adults who can't read. We are looking for three, very special people, who have the skills, expertise, experience, passion, and time to be part of something amazing that is about to fundamentally change the lives of millions of children. Right now, millions of children have no hope; but soon, they will have the opportunity to learn how to read, which, in turn, will open a window to education and to a world of potential for them that, not only, has never been opened before, but that has never even been seriously contemplated as a potential reality. What we are talking about is an adaptive learning, smartphone app, that can literally, teach a child to read in about 12 hours of total use time! We are the American Youth Literacy Foundation, and we have been teaching children how to read for 11 years! We have been developing this app for about two years, and our goal is to launch this incredible smartphone app in the App Store and on Google Play by Thanksgiving of 2020! We are partnered with an engineering team that was one of the five $1 million finalists in the XPrize for Global Learning competition, the winners of which were announced this past May, which was a worldwide competition for app design and development teams from around the world to design, build and deliver a tablet-based app to children in remote villages in Africa which could teach them how to read and do basic math (children of all ages, most of whom had never been to school before in their lives). The curriculum that our app is based on is a patented reading decoding system, and is so effective at teaching children how to read, that it usually only takes 4-6 hours for them to understand the system, and another 4-6 hours for them to reach a 2nd grade reading level. Compare this to many of our students who have been in the public school system for 6 years and still can't spell the word \\\"the.\\\" Compare this to millions of students who have dropped out of school, primarily because they can't read (more than 10 million per decade). More than 20 million children in grades 3-12 in America's public schools today can't read! Our organization is an 11 year old, nationwide, charitable 501 c 3 non-profit. We started out as a tutoring program and we still tutor. But our focus has always been on finding a scaleable solution to the literacy crisis in America. With the rise of the smartphone and the amazing penetration of this powerful tool, even into the most impoverished communities, we feel that the answer we have been searching for IS in the form of an app. So for the past several years we have been working to convert our amazing reading curriculum, that teaches children how to read in just 12 hours, into an app that teaches children how to read in about the same time. And this is where you come in. We have a LOT of opportunity in front of us to build, test, and deliver an end user experience (the UX) to millions of children in America's inner cities and rural lands, to the barrios and the suburbs, and to the American Indian reservations, and everywhere in-between, with this smartphone app. But in order to do this, we need to complete three pieces of the equation: The Horse, The Cart, and the Payload. The Horse is the curriculum; and it is well under way in the conversion process from an analog to a digital pedagogy. The Cart is the distribution system, the \\\"how do we get it out into communities and to the children, once it's built?\\\" Despite what some may think, just because we put an app in the App Store, doesn't mean it will go viral. There's an old adage that goes, \\\"build a better mousetrap, and the world will NOT beat a path to your door!\\\" You still have to market, publicize and distribute your invention, even if it's FREE, like ours! And the Payload is the UX (the user experience). But it's not just the child (the ultimate beneficiary) who must enjoy the experience enough to continue through the progressive learning modules, but it's the parent, or guardian, or friend, or grandparent, or sibling, or concerned adult, who must also be supported. And for that we are building the support system and the support network that will scale with the app, and not constrain the growth and penetration of the app into the interstitial spaces of American society. The UX must be tested and must be proven to work in a controlled environment before it is released into an uncontrolled environment like the App Store or Google Play, where its success will depend upon ease of use, ease of understanding and the support that we provide to caring adults who download the app for the purpose of saving their child from living a life of impoverishment, without education, and without hope.

We will find a match for you. Please call Julie Ford at (973) 310-9478 to learn more about this program. Once you are matched with a client, you contact your client first by phone, then make arrangements for a first shopping visit. You will go to your client's home to pick up a list and coupons, and the form of payment of course. Once you have shopped, you simply return to the client's home with the list, the groceries and the change, and if needed, help the client to put away the groceries.

Visits made by our volunteers not only help each patient, but the families are truly touched as well. The shortest conversation can have the largest impact. VITAS volunteers provide relief care for caregivers, offer companionship for the patient, run errands and help in other meaningful ways. This is a great opportunity for you to give back to the community. By taking a small amount of time out of your busy week you can make the biggest difference in another&rsquo;s life. VITAS takes pride in its volunteers, and we welcome you to become part of our team. There are many locations throughout the area you can choose from. Your commitment is completely up to you, whether you spend one day a week or one day a month. Your time is always appreciated.

For the past 15 years, GOSO has served thousands of justice-involved young men in New York City as they reshape their futures and become positive forces in their communities. GOSO&rsquo;s work is based on a holistic approach of our Three E&rsquo;s: Education: Education is fundamental to our participants' success. Not only does GOSO encourage participants to earn their high school diploma or TASC (formerly GED) through our school program, but we also provide workshops and individual counseling designed to keep young men in school and encourage exploration of different education opportunities, including higher education. Employment: Meaningful work experience that builds skills and open doors is also crucial. Our two-week job readiness curriculum leads to our robust employment program, GOSOWorks, which connects participants with our city-wide network of 70+ employer partners. Emotional Well-Being: Our staff of experienced and knowledgeable licensed social workers provide emotional support to our participants, more than 50% of whom are living with mental health issues and need helpful resources. Through programming and supportive services administered by a staff of some of the hardest working and most positive individuals in NYC, our participants are able to build on their existing skills and develop new ones to use in their future career, education, and daily lives. GOSO also hosts Stand Against Violence East Harlem (SAVE), which is part of the nationwide Cure Violence initiative. SAVE&rsquo;s mission is to treat violence like an epidemic, and to prevent the spread of violence by stopping it at its source. SAVE's team of Outreach Workers and Violence Interrupters go out into the East Harlem community to detect and interrupt conflicts, treat high-risk individuals, and change the social and community norms. Their goal is to reduce violence and create a safer and stronger community. For more information about GOSO, please visit our website at https://www.gosonyc.org/.

The Comprehensive Community Hospice Program of Parker Jewish Institute is looking for people who would like to volunteer as a doula, going out to patients' homes and extending the hand of reassurance, offering a smile that warms the heart, and the words that say everything will be okay. Volunteer Doulas will help patients and families cope with the process of dying, remaining at the bedside as life ends. \\\"Doula\\\" is a Greek word that means \\\"woman servant or caregiver.\\\" Today it is associated with individuals who provide physical assistance and emotional support during and/or after childbirth. This proposed program aims to mirror the concept by providing the same type of support at the final phase of a terminal illness. This initiative will place a focus on planning for death with the elderly patient and family if there is one, and will provide a continuous around the clock vigil as death becomes imminent. The program will help the elderly patient who lacks family or adequate caregiver support to die comfortably, without fear of being alone. Even when surrounded by loved ones, individuals with a terminal illness and those closest to them may feel isolated as they face the end of life. As the end of life approaches, patients and families struggle with anxiety and fear; exhaustion; loved ones often feel alone, unprepared and afraid; and opportunities to explore meaning go unaddressed. Hospice Doulas provide emotional support and comfort to patients and their loved ones in the final phase of a terminal illness. Our End-of-Life (EOL) Doula volunteers will receive thorough training in understanding the dying process and in the skills that help bring peace and comfort to all involved. This free two-day training includes learning how to do guided visualization, help create rituals, provide simple physical support, offer sacred presence, as well as how to create spiritual and emotional legacies. Parker Jewish institute will be hosting a free two-day Doula training workshop on Saturday 10/28/17 and Sunday 10/29/17 from 9:00am-6:00pm. Breakfast and lunch will be served. A certificate will be awarded upon completion of this workshop. If you are interested in attending, please call the Hospice Program's Volunteer Doula Coordinator at 718-289-2134, or email volunteer-nerken@parkerinstitute.org. Doulas can come from any background and no experience is required. They typically work in as part of a team. They usually sit quietly with a patient, talk with them and offer support, comfort and companionship.

Hospice volunteers are a special group of people that use their time and talents to enrich the quality of life for our patients and their families as the end of life approaches. Hospice volunteers enhance the quality of life and help reduce the burden for family caregivers by providing support, assistance, in patient&rsquo;s homes, in nursing homes, and assisted living facilities. To be a volunteer, there is no special requirement other than a sincere desire to help people and the ability to listen. The most important thing you can do is be there for patients to reassure them they are not alone. It is not an easy undertaking, but it can enrich your life well as patients and families. Hospice volunteers can commit to as little or as much time as they wish. Some volunteers provide several hours of service each week while others commit to a few hours each month. Serving as valued members of the hospice team, for just a few hours of your time you can make a significant impact on the lives of patients and their loved ones. There are many opportunities to share your time and talents as a volunteer and support patients, their loved ones dealing with end of life. Opportunities include: Hospice Doulas Bereavement/Grief Patient Friendly Visits Legacy Projects Administrative Support Community Education Help Recruiting Other Volunteers Note: We ask that those who have recently lost a loved one wait a year before becoming a hospice volunteer. You are welcome to participate in our bereavement programs during this time. All hospice volunteers receive extensive training. Depending the type of volunteering, training is can range from 6-18 hours. All volunteers must complete our new volunteer orientation.

Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families of patients who have passed.

Consequently, we're always looking for volunteer softball coaches, particularly those with experience playing or coaching sports at the college level and beyond. Currently, we have an emphasis and focus on finding more female softball coaches who can serve as role models for the girls in our program. We firmly believe that this plays a critical role in impacting the perceptions and future aspirations of our girls and how they see and understand leadership in the world. Over the long term, we aspire to achieve at least a 50-50 gender split of coaches.

Therefore, we create Memory Books, in which we categorize items such as food, holidays, sports, cars, flowers/gardens, people, people showing emotion such as hugs, etc. Volunteers create these books by finding and cutting out pictures or scenes from magazines, cards, calendars, etc. We sit with the patients and review these categories to see if any memory is stimulated and many times it is.

It takes a lot of time, hours and dedication to put these books together and a great deal of material is needed to complete them.

Volunteer Musicians play one song per room and interact with patients, their families and hospital staff. All lyrics MUST be appropriate for a hospital setting, therefore MOC provides an approved song list for musicians to select their repertoire for hospital visits. Any other material outside of the approved song list may be submitted to MOC staff for approval. Musician applicants must also submit a sample of their music prior to acceptance into the program. Volunteer Musicians must complete MOC's training process which is outlined below. Guides Volunteer Guides escort Volunteer Musicians from room to room as they play music for patients. Volunteer Guides knock on each hospital room door and ask patients if they feel like hearing music. They also introduce the musicians prior to their performances and guide them through the facility. Each guide is assigned to a specific healthcare facility. The Volunteer Guide is the \\\"eyes and ears\\\" of MOC during the Bedside Performance Program as well as the liaison between the hospital and the Volunteer Musician.

WE NEED TUTORS RIGHT NOW to start supporting underserved children so they can build skills to do well on standardized tests and for entry into competitive, quality middle and high schools. We also seek a coordinator who can help us run this new program. Every weekend and free time you can give, let us know. We will assign you a child and you must be dedicated to that student at least three months. You can share the responsibility with another, but it must be intense and helpful for aspiring, hardworking students who come from underserved schools. Hours - Location will be at Grand Army Library or Eastern Parkway library or Medger Evers College or other location you can determine close to Flatbush, Crown Heights, Brownsville, Brooklyn. We want to add this to our soccer program and our Hip2B Healthy program, so we are thinking Saturday mornings, 9-1 or Sundays 12-4 or anytime between 9 am and 6 pm on Saturdays and 1-5 pm on Sundays. We can find other times and other locations. Children come from central Brooklyn (Crown Heights, etc) Background - We have an initiative with Seeds in the Middle to give every child a chance to learn the academic skills to gain entry into New York City's top high schools - starting as early as 3rd or 4th grade. Why? Despite increasing funding and initiatives, the percentage of African-American and Latino students in NYC is far below their numbers in the NYC population. See the article here - showing in 2017 that only 10 percent of the seats offered went to minority students. https://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2017/03/08/only-10-percent-of-offers-at-new-york-citys-specialized-high-schools-went-to-black-and-hispanic-students/ Who are we? Seeds in the Middle has been working with students, faculties and parents and the community in central Brooklyn since 2010. We have seen the challenges and want to work closely with people who care to give children real chances to get the same access to top colleges as those in more affluent communities. We think we have an innovative solution to helping students achieve so they can have an equal shot at these schools - including competitive schools like LaGuardia High School of Performing Arts or Midwood or Murrow or any other school recognized as top by the most competitive colleges. That's you! Help us create a new pathway for students! Empower real change. 2019-2020 - Volunteers who can help prepare students for the Specialized High School test are asked to commit at least two hours a week end for as long as you can commit (at least a month)... Next test is in fall 2020. ATTENTION - If you want to tutor younger ages or do anything further, read below For the long-term plan, WE ask for commitments of at least three months, or you can work for years with a student on special skills. You must: sign that commitment when you finish your term, explain to the next tutor what you are working on with the student confer with our certified educators for guidance so you know exactly what they need to work on. STUDENTS - WE CAN GIVE COMMUNITY SERVICE HOURS FOR THIS. Locations? May vary - it might be Brooklyn Central Library near Grand Army Plaza or a school in Brownsville, Flatbush or Crown Heights, Brooklyn or maybe right at Stuyvesant High School or one of the top high schools. If you have a location near a train, let us know. Who are the students you will tutor? Each student must write a letter or essay, saying why he or she wants to go to a top high school and signing, with a parent, their commitment to coming every week for as long as it takes. We are starting at 3rd or 4th grade, and offer this to students through 8th grade. We hope to launch this on MLK weekend 2018 - so respond right away. PS - We would like to ask every volunteer to donate $50 or anything to help support our efforts. If you just want to tutor and cannot give, that is okay. But this is an unfunded program, so we are asking for donations to pay the people who are creating and organizing these opportunities and to administer this. All donations are tax-deductible. If you are willing to fundraise at all - even a bake sale - for our efforts, we would truly appreciate. Our goal is $20,000 and we want to offer tutors to as many children who want it - can be 100 or more... you can see what we do at seedsinthemiddle.org and on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/seedsinthemiddle/ What is our goal? To get at least 20 students into any of these schools, maybe more. But our initial goal is to ensure at least 20 students get the education necessary to pass the specialized high school test or other tests to go to the school of their choice - who - WITHOUT YOU - would never get a chance to get in.

Feel free to also check us out on our website to learn more about us at www.TEACH4Kids.org Who We Are: TEACH (Together Educating All Children in Hospitals) is an international not-for-profit organization that brings exciting, hands-on, STEM educational programming to children in hospitals. Our mission is to create an outlet for children of all ages to passionately engage with the sciences through the medium of fun, interactive experiments. Through engagement with practical science concepts, the children are challenged yet empowered. They emerge comforted and confident, encouraged to successfully cope with the trials that lie before them. TEACH modules challenge children to think creatively and bring an element of fun to an otherwise monotonous day. When TEACH volunteers visit, children get excited and get to experience STEM topics through more than 75 different interactive modules. Patients can learn about real life concepts while also having an exceptional amount of fun. They are amazed as they create silly putty while they learn about polymers and use basic engineering principles to build boats that really float. Observing the science of physiological respiration using yeast to inflate a balloon or discovering density by creating their very own lava lamps truly changes the way they view science, their stay in the hospital and life. What makes us special is that TEACH was founded by and is entirely run by students. In Spring 2013, TEACH&rsquo;s two co-founders were inspired to help with the need for interaction and activity, the craving for a personal bond, and the lack of mental and physical stimulation exhibited by hospitalized children. Under the mentorship and guidance of Dr. Edward Burns of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, TEACH was created to heal through teaching. TEACH began with monthly modules in a local Bronx hospital. In just over a year, TEACH grew to reach nine hospitals with hundreds of students signed up to volunteer from various universities around the tristate area. We have served over 3000 children, 30 hospitals internationally, and 1000 volunteers. What TEACH Needs TEACH is seeking an enthusiastic and passionate individual that wants to make a difference in the lives of medically ill children. We need someone who is committed to the organization both in the time they commit to as well as a financial responsibility to support the organization. Our Advisory board members are required to be active within the organization and play a significant role in the growth of the organization. Advisory Board Member Responsibilities TEACH Advisory board will meet periodically and communicates via email and phone at various times throughout the year. Advisory Board members are required to assist fundraising efforts and participate in at least one committee. Some of the things that they would need to participate in would be to promote events, participate in peer to peer campaigns, help with corporate partnerships and networking.

Consider joining a board for a non-profit that is driven by a singular mission with a huge impact: The Gift of Adoption Fund seeks to fill the void that separates child from family through adoption completion grants, giving vulnerable children a permanent home and the chance to thrive. Gift of Adoption is a national 501(c)(3) that provides the final funds that prospective adoptive parents need to complete the adoptions of vulnerable children from within the U.S. and from around the world. Networking and fundraising are the primary responsibilities of board members. To fundraise, we organize fun social events, online campaigns and more. The board currently consists of professionals who volunteer their time and connections to further the cause. You can live anywhere in the state but are expected to participate in monthly calls and, ideally, quarterly in-person meetings. 100% of the money we raise goes directly to completing families' adoptions in your state. We are a team of smart, dedicated (and, we like to think, fun!) people who believe that a loving family is a basic human right. We are looking for Board Members who: - Are passionate about volunteering to help children. - Have creative fundraising ideas and the motivation and social network to make them happen! - Are connected to and/or interested in outreach to the local business community. - Enjoy connecting people and finding partnership opportunities. - Are comfortable reaching out to their network of family and friends about a good cause. - Have strong communication skills, and are highly organized. - Want a volunteer opportunity that makes a permanent difference! We expect that you will: - Help plan and attend fundraising events. - Work with the other board members to collectively raise money to fund adoptions. - Participate in one board call a month. - Attend a quarterly in-person meeting. -Make a personal donation each year that you serve on the board, and meet a fundraising goal. - Help recruit other board members to join the mission.

Often, regularly scheduled visits are requested, however Music Volunteers may also be asked to provide musical visits on an occasional basis for one patient/family or for a group of patients at a facility as outreach for the local hospice agency. Hospice is built on the philosophy that we care for our patients in mind, body and soul. Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, memory bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network.

Our nonprofit focuses on news about making the world a better place, particularly news related to topics such as global poverty, nonprofits, climate change and human rights. All volunteering is via the computer -- you can be anywhere in the world. The Daily Source is truly a 21st century journalism site. Our online software is incredibly easy to use and automates most of the layout process. Just drag and drop articles from one location to another and the page adjusts itself automatically. Editing the headlines is as easy as using Microsoft Word or sending an e-mail. You will receive guidance from our senior editors who are some of the top newspaper journalists in the U.S. Besides laying out the front page, you will find articles, videos, columns and other material from around the Internet for use on the site and make the final decision of what goes on the site. You will be doing real stuff that directly impacts our front page and our nonprofit's mission to help the world. You will also gain invaluable experience that will build your skills and look great on a resume. Some of our volunteers have gone on to work in the journalism field. Two of our volunteers started their own non-profit organization after eight months of volunteering with us. One of our editors was hired full-time by Wired.com and another was hired by Congress as the official congressional photographer of senators at public events. We have an extensive training process that is about a month long, so if we are going to train you, we need you to do a certain amount of hours in all to make it worth the time we put into it. Therefore, the Front Page Editor role is a minimum of 15 hours per week for a minimum of six months. If you can volunteer 20 hours or higher a week, then the minimum is only five months, or you can do 12 hours a week for seven and a half months. We tend to give preference to applicants who can do a sizable number of hours. All editors are credited at the bottom of the site each day, and daily editions are archived so your friends, family and future employers will see what you were part of creating. To view our front page, visit - http://dailysource.org/ To read more about us, view the links here - http://dailysource.org/about/site We usually also have the following openings (minimum hours per week and minimum number of months are in parenthesis). All these positions are telecommute so you don&rsquo;t have to drive or dress up, and can work from the comfort of your home. You might also be able to use our local Internet location, though there is some cost for that so virtual is preferred. If you apply for a position, you should view your commitment to it the same as if it were a paid position. We treat volunteers like normal staff and rely on them like staff. Our site is 99% volunteer run and we all depend on each other to make it a success. Please do not apply if you are viewing this opportunity as \\\"just a volunteer position\\\" and would treat it as less important than paid positions or other commitments you have. If you are in school, volunteering with us can function as an internship. Interns can usually receive credit with their school for their internships. Content Editor (10 hours a week for a minimum of 6 months): Searches the Internet for high quality articles, columns, editorials and videos, adds them to our system, and ranks them by quality. The front page editors pick from these to publish on the front page. Also does research and fact-checking when needed. This requires Internet surfing skills, strong understanding and judgment of the news, and attention to detail. Marketing and Social Media (6 hours a week for a minimum of 5 months): Help research potential media outlets and blogs to cover our site, e-mail our press releases to them, and keep track of coverage of our site that has occurred. We have a great website and need to get the word out about it. Help promote the website by updating our Facebook, Twitter and other social media pages, attracting new followers, and interacting with our existing followers. No marketing experience required, but you must be familiar with social media and be good at communicating. If you're interested in volunteering, please email us at volunteer@dailysource.org and let us know: * Which position or positions are you interested in? * How many hours per week and how many months can you do? We tend to give preference to people who can do more hours. * A description of your past work/volunteer experience and education, or a resume or a link to a LinkedIn profile. You can also apply directly through this website by clicking the button for that, and giving us the same information.

We welcome your gifts of time and compassion. Whether you choose to work directly with patients and families or to volunteer in one of many other ways, you can make a profound difference in someone's life, including your own. Volunteers are an integral part of the hospice team. Volunteers are needed in all areas of NJ! Volunteer Opportunities: Companionship Volunteers work directly with patients providing companionship, offering friendly visits, reading to patients, writing letters, offering a gentle touch or sharing a quiet moment. Complementary Volunteers are certified/trained professionals who can provide complementary modalities of reflexology, music, imagery and touch therapies such as Reiki, massage, therapeutic touch and healing hands. Pet Therapy Volunteers provide certified/trained pets who visit with patients. These animals provide loving memories for some and give unconditional love helping our patients feel connected to a larger world. Administrative Volunteers provide help to the staff in our Edison office by assisting with typing, addressing cards, organizing newsletters, creating packets, collating manuals and other varied clerical duties Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, huggable dolls/bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Junior Volunteers consist of groups such as girl/boy scouts or young people who wish to honor our patients by making holiday cards, posters, wall hangings and memory books. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families and friends of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network. Hospice training classes are required for Companionship and Complementary Volunteers. They are free of charge and offered on an ongoing basis. Grace Healthcare Services serves counties throughout New Jersey. Areas where you are needed include: Atlantic County, Bergen County, Cape May County, Essex County, Hudson County, Mercer County, Middlesex County, Monmouth County, Morris County, North Passaic County, Ocean County, Somerset County, South Passaic County, Burlington County, Camden County and Union County.

Our nonprofit focuses on news about making the world a better place, particularly news related to topics such as global poverty, nonprofits, climate change and human rights. All volunteering is via the computer -- you can be anywhere in the world. The Daily Source is truly a 21st century journalism site. Our online software is incredibly easy to use and automates most of the layout process. Just drag and drop articles from one location to another and the page adjusts itself automatically. Editing the headlines is as easy as using Microsoft Word or sending an e-mail. You will receive guidance from our senior editors who are some of the top newspaper journalists in the U.S. Besides laying out the front page, you will find articles, videos, columns and other material from around the Internet for use on the site and make the final decision of what goes on the site. You will be doing real stuff that directly impacts our front page and our nonprofit's mission to help the world. You will also gain invaluable experience that will build your skills and look great on a resume. Some of our volunteers have gone on to work in the journalism field. Two of our volunteers started their own non-profit organization after eight months of volunteering with us. One of our editors was hired full-time by Wired.com and another was hired by Congress as the official congressional photographer of senators at public events. We have an extensive training process that is about a month long, so if we are going to train you, we need you to do a certain amount of hours in all to make it worth the time we put into it. Therefore, the Front Page Editor role is a minimum of 15 hours per week for a minimum of six months. If you can volunteer 20 hours or higher a week, then the minimum is only five months, or you can do 12 hours a week for seven and a half months. We tend to give preference to applicants who can do a sizable number of hours. All editors are credited at the bottom of the site each day, and daily editions are archived so your friends, family and future employers will see what you were part of creating. To view our front page, visit - http://dailysource.org/ To read more about us, view the links here - http://dailysource.org/about/site We usually also have the following openings (minimum hours per week and minimum number of months are in parenthesis). All these positions are telecommute so you don&rsquo;t have to drive or dress up, and can work from the comfort of your home. You might also be able to use our local Internet location, though there is some cost for that so virtual is preferred. If you apply for a position, you should view your commitment to it the same as if it were a paid position. We treat volunteers like normal staff and rely on them like staff. Our site is 99% volunteer run and we all depend on each other to make it a success. Please do not apply if you are viewing this opportunity as \\\"just a volunteer position\\\" and would treat it as less important than paid positions or other commitments you have. If you are in school, volunteering with us can function as an internship. Interns can usually receive credit with their school for their internships. Content Editor (10 hours a week for a minimum of 6 months): Searches the Internet for high quality articles, columns, editorials and videos, adds them to our system, and ranks them by quality. The front page editors pick from these to publish on the front page. Also does research and fact-checking when needed. This requires Internet surfing skills, strong understanding and judgment of the news, and attention to detail. Marketing and Social Media (6 hours a week for a minimum of 5 months): Help research potential media outlets and blogs to cover our site, e-mail our press releases to them, and keep track of coverage of our site that has occurred. We have a great website and need to get the word out about it. Help promote the website by updating our Facebook, Twitter and other social media pages, attracting new followers, and interacting with our existing followers. No marketing experience required, but you must be familiar with social media and be good at communicating. If you're interested in volunteering, please email us at volunteer@dailysource.org and let us know: * Which position or positions are you interested in? * How many hours per week and how many months can you do? We tend to give preference to people who can do more hours. * A description of your past work/volunteer experience and education, or a resume or a link to a LinkedIn profile. You can also apply directly through this website by clicking the button for that, and giving us the same information.

Grace Healthcare Services is a Hospice organization that cares for patients throughout NJ. Veterans at the end of life. Volunteers are an essential component of this care. WHY A NEED FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS? -Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect to patients who have served our country. -Veterans share a common bond and code of conduct. -The camaraderie that exists between Veterans has proven to be a great support for the Veterans we care for. As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee. Please help us honor our Veterans by giving them the gift of your time.

Sprout is a non-profit organization based in New York City focused on providing innovative programs for adults with developmental disabilities.With our network of resources and dedicated volunteers, which we call leaders, Sprout opens up fascinating new worlds to people with disabilities. Sprout's Overnight Vacations Program is looking for individuals who have the energy, motivation and desire to work with adults with developmental disabilities. What do Sprout leaders do? Sprout leaders' primary goal is to give adults with developmental disabilities the opportunity to experience and enjoy recreational, educational and leisure activities through overnight vacations. Leaders are responsible for the overall safety and enjoyment of their group, 24 hours a day, while on a Sprout trip. Duties include safety monitoring, personal hygiene assistance, providing physical and emotional support, activity planning, budgeting, logistics, and enhancing fun. The work is hard yet immensely rewarding as you develop leadership skills and gain insight into your own abilities. What type of training is provided? Leaders must complete a pre-service training, which provides the necessary procedures and tools to run a successful and enjoyable vacation. Leaders who are drivers receive extra training on how to safely drive our 15-passenger vans. In addition, all leaders receive a copy of Sprout's Leadership Handbook to help with policies and guidelines. What is the time commitment? Sprout vacations last 3 - 7 days depending on the time of year and destination of the trip. When a leader is selected for an overnight vacation, Sprout asks that the leader dedicate themselves to stay with their group throughout the entire duration of the vacation. Some leaders only choose to lead one trip a year while others spend several months with us leading up to 8 trips or more. Sprout strives to make our program flexible for our leaders based on the amount of time leaders can give. Do leaders have any free or personal time while on a trip? Sprout trips are working vacations for the leaders who choose to participate. Because Sprout leaders are responsible for their group 24 hours a day, there is no free or personal time allotted. In order to give our participants the opportunity to experience and enjoy a vacation, Sprout leaders must be available at all times to provide the support any one participant may need. What type of trips can Sprout leaders expect to join? A majority of Sprout trips take place within a day's drive of New York City. Destinations include Atlantic City, Amish Country, Boston, Lake George, Cleveland, Maine and Virginia Beach. Exotic trips like cruises, Hawaii, and Europe are presented to leaders who have demonstrated high levels of commitment, service hours and have gained positive feedback from participants and Sprout office staff. Are there any special skills or requirements? No special background or education is required to become a Sprout leader. We encourage people from all cultures and professions, and of all ethnic and educational backgrounds. Once accepted into the program, you will receive the necessary tools to sign up for outings and how to assist our participants. Requirements include: -21+ years old -Provide references -Participate in training session -Willingness to complete necessary background checks -Evaluate participants' behavior -Fluent English -Willing to drive a 15 passenger van -Love to travel & have fun!

Nearly 70 percent of those placed in solitary had a mental health disorder, with nearly 37% having two or more diagnoses. \uf0b7 Youth suffer abuse while in adult prison: once incarcerated in an adult prison, one in four youth surveyed reported physical abuse; 5% reported sexual abuse.

Four-month-old Bosley is a puppy with a special mission. One day, he will provide enhanced independence and mobility to a person with disabilities - whether they're blind or visually impaired, or have a disability other than blindness. But Bosley isn't growing up at the Guide Dog Foundation for the Blind. Each year, the Guide Dog Foundation breeds about 300 exceptional puppies, and it's vital that Bosley and other pups like him spend the first year of their lives with surrounded by the love and security of volunteer foster families called puppy walkers. Puppy walkers help Foundation puppies grow up to be confident dogs. What's involved in raising a Guide Dog Foundation puppy? Bosley went to live with his puppy walkers when he was about nine weeks old. He's learning basic obedience and social skills while being exposed to many different situations. People who raise Guide Dog Foundation puppies say it is the most rewarding thing they've ever done. Puppy raisers come from everywhere - stay-at-home moms or dads, teachers, college students, retirees, people with flexible work environments - and are crucial members of the Guide Dog Foundation family. By opening their hearts and homes to a puppy, a puppy raiser plays a crucial role in helping a person with disabilities live an independent life. Every puppy walker family works with a Guide Dog Foundation puppy adviser, who is available to answer questions and offer guidance and support. When he is about 14 months old, Bosley will return to the Guide Dog Foundation's Smithtown campus to begin his training as a guide or service dog. Puppy raisers will admit it's tough to say good-bye, but when they see the pup they raised take its place at the side of someone with disabilities, the ache they feel turns pride. There are puppies waiting now to join your loving home for a chance to start their careers.

Volunteers at Brooklyn Historical Society (BHS) offer valuable assistance to staff, visitors, and the public in a variety of ways. Passionate about the past, present, and future of Brooklyn, volunteers are individuals who enjoy engaging with the diverse communities who make up our great borough. BHS welcomes volunteers who have a sincere desire to lend their time and their skills to the institution. Volunteer opportunities are subject to availability and applicant&rsquo;s qualifications. Brooklyn Historical Society (BHS) is pleased to announce An Opening, an audio and visual installation by Brooklyn-based artist Kameelah Janan Rasheed, who is known for her immersive large-scale installations, text-based art work, publications, and audio recordings. Rasheed draws on BHS&rsquo;s Muslims in Brooklyn oral histories to create a unique audio and visual experience that challenges narrow conceptions of Muslim identity and history. The installation and oral histories are part of Muslims in Brooklyn, a public arts and history project launched by BHS in 2017 to preserve and amplify stories of Brooklyn&rsquo;s diverse Muslim communities. An Opening invites visitors to experience these conversations both visually and aurally as they explore an ecosystem of sound and art that moves beyond linear narrative, fixed categories, and static identities. Visitors to the exhibition are outfitted with an iPod Touch and headphones. As they move around the room, they hear sounds of speech and snippets of stories, as if encountering conversations in a crowded room. As they stand facing each new work of art in the gallery, the iPod Touch plays an audio piece, selected by the artist, to accompany the image. Rasheed has created a non-linear and fluid experience determined entirely by the body&rsquo;s movement and positioning, offering each visitor a chance to direct their own individual experience. BHS is seeking volunteers to help support the visitor experience of An Opening. Responsibilities Distribute iPods and headsets to guests Help answer tech related questions Make sure guests do not leave the exhibition area with the tech equipment Keep an eye out for guests who may be mishandling or abusing the equipment Provide translations (transcripts of exhibit text will be available in several languages) to guests on an as-needed basis Be familiar with the building and its features (location of restrooms, galleries, library, exits, etc.) Required Skills Superior customer service skills Demonstrated ability to problem-solve quickly and efficiently Proactive, action oriented team member willing to take direction from supervisors Excellent communications skills Experience and comfort with technology (iPod touch, headphones) Team player with an engaging, outgoing personality.

Grace Healthcare Services is a Hospice organization that cares for patients throughout NJ. Veterans at the end of life. Volunteers are an essential component of this care. WHY A NEED FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS? -Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect to patients who have served our country. -Veterans share a common bond and code of conduct. -The camaraderie that exists between Veterans has proven to be a great support for the Veterans we care for. As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee. Please help us honor our Veterans by giving them the gift of your time.

Grace Healthcare Services is a Hospice organization that cares for patients throughout NJ. Veterans at the end of life. Volunteers are an essential component of this care. WHY A NEED FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS? -Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect to patients who have served our country. -Veterans share a common bond and code of conduct. -The camaraderie that exists between Veterans has proven to be a great support for the Veterans we care for. As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee. Please help us honor our Veterans by giving them the gift of your time.

We are looking for passionate volunteer Compass Coaches who are excited to lead 10th grade nXu Fellows through this year-long Purpose Exploration journey. Using our curriculum, each volunteer Compass Coach will guide their Compass Team (~8 participants) through a series of pre-scripted and planned immersive activities, conversations, exercises, and reflections. With support from Compass Coaches, Fellows will form valuable bonds and expand their self-knowledge. We are looking for volunteer Compass Coaches who: Represent a range of identity markers and professional experiences. Show an interest in exploring their own self-development.

With support from the Lead Compass Coach, volunteer Compass Coaches will guide the nXu Fellows through the day and support them in learning the session&rsquo;s objective through a series of engaging activities/practices, reflections, and authentic conversations. Volunteer Compass Coaches will build a culture of curiosity and vulnerability, ask questions, lead discussions, share their own experiences, and actively engage in the day&rsquo;s activities with the Fellows.

Here is an opportunity to help underprivileged children, to help under-served children, to help ALL children, and even to help adults who can't read. We are looking for three, very special people, who have the skills, expertise, experience, passion, and time to be part of something amazing that is about to fundamentally change the lives of millions of children, who right now, have no hope, but who will soon have the opportunity to learn how to read, which, in turn, will open a window to education and to a world of potential for them that, not only, has never been opened before, but that has never even been seriously contemplated as a possible reality, as opposed to just a pipe dream or a fantasy. What we are talking about is an adaptive learning, smartphone app, that can literally, teach a child to read in about 12 hours of total use time! We are the American Youth Literacy Foundation, and we have been teaching children how to read for 11 years! We have been developing this app for about two years, and our goal is to launch this incredible smartphone app in the App Store and on Google Play by Thanksgiving of 2020! We are partnered with an engineering team that was one of the five $1 million finalists in the XPrize for Global Learning competition, the winners of which were announced this past May, which was a worldwide competition for app design and development teams from around the world to design, build and deliver a tablet-based app to children in remote villages in Africa which could teach them how to read and do basic math (children of all ages, most of whom had never been to school before in their lives). The curriculum that our app is based on is a patented reading decoding system, and is so effective at teaching children how to read, that it usually only takes 4-6 hours for them to understand the system, and another 4-6 hours for them to reach a 2nd grade reading level. Compare this to many of our students who have been in the public school system for 6 years and still can't spell the word \\\"the.\\\" Compare this to millions of students who have dropped out of school, primarily because they can't read (more than 10 million per decade). More than 20 million children in grades 3-12 in America's public schools today can't read! Our organization is an 11 year old, nationwide, charitable 501 c 3 non-profit. We started out as a tutoring program and we still tutor. But our focus has always been on finding a scaleable solution to the literacy crisis in America. With the rise of the smartphone and the amazing penetration of this powerful tool, even into the most impoverished communities, we feel that the answer we have been searching for IS in the form of an app. So for the past several years we have been working to convert our amazing reading curriculum that teaches children how to read in 12 hours, into an app that teaches children how to read in 12 hours. And this is where you come in. We have a LOT of opportunity in front of us to build, test, and deliver an end user experience (the UX) to millions of children in America's inner cities and rural lands, to the barrios and the suburbs and American Indian reservations and everywhere in-between, with this smartphone app. But in order to do this, we need to complete three pieces of the equation: The Horse, The Cart, and the Payload. The Horse is the curriculum; and it is well under way in the conversion process from analog to a digital pedagogy. The Cart is the distribution system, the \\\"how do we get it out into communities and to the children, once it's built?\\\" And the Payload is the UX (the user experience). But it's not just the child(who is the ultimate end user), but it's the parent or guardian or friend, or grandparent or sibling or concerned adult who must also be supported. And for that we are building the support system and the support network that will scale with the app and not constrain the growth and penetration of the app. The UX must be tested and must be proven to work in a controlled environment before it is released into an uncontrolled environment like the App Store or Google Play, where its success will depend upon ease of use, ease of understanding and the support that we provide to caring adults who download the app for the purpose of saving their child from living a life of impoverishment, without education, and without hope. All of this development, whether it's the curriculum, the distribution system or the user experience, takes graphic design production and support. Building our curriculum and testing it in the field requires raw, pdf draft versions of the app that can be downloaded by tutors across the country working with kids, then modified as needed before they are enshrined in html and javascript code for the digital experience. Marketing and distribution require graphic support and materials. The UX support system for caring adults requires information and digital tools that contain critical information that is presented in an easy to use format. There's much more to tell. You can read more about our story and about us on our website at www.YouthLit.org. All of this requires Adobe Suite support, so right now we are looking for 3 very special people to be a part of our Lead Design Team. We are looking for 3 very special people who have everything we mentioned above, passion, expertise, time, etc. to join our team and help us launch this app in 2020. Our 3 person, Lead Design Team will help us design and build multiple curriculum, as well as marketing and support materials that are critical to the app's success! The Lead Design Team will hire future designers for specific tasking as needed. If you are interested in becoming a \\\"task specific\\\" graphic design team member, please also contact us and we will file your resume appropriately for a later date. If you wish to be considered for this opportunity to be a member of our Lead Design Team, please send us a cover letter and resume to info@YouthLit.org. We are looking for intelligent, creative, enthusiastic, cheerful, optimistic individuals with significant experience in both digital and print media. We are looking for hands on, \\\"can do\\\" individuals who are willing to execute production tasks. We are looking for designers who have extensive experience in Adobe Creative Suite. This is a complex undertaking and we are looking for highly proficient and organized individuals to help build the materials needed for an effective product launch, and to hire and coordinate other individuals who likely will be needed to fill in the gaps and complete critical projects in support of the app. Just to be clear, our organization is an extended, virtual network, comprised of individuals around the country who collaborate through digital, internet-based tools. Individuals interested in this position should have experience organizing tasking across a variety of networks and platforms. Thank you! We hope this opportunity finds you at the right place and the right time in your career to make a difference and an impact, in an amazing way, for millions of children who are waiting for someone, or some thing, to lead them out of a life of impoverishment and into a future of unlimited possibility and potential.

Guiding Principles As a board member, I understand that I owe duties of care, loyalty, and obedience to the organization and the children it serves. The duty of care is the duty to monitor Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s activities, see that its mission is being accomplished, and guard its financial resources. The duty of loyalty is the duty to avoid conflicts of interest. The duty of obedience is to be faithful to Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s mission and to comply with the law. I will uphold these duties and do my utmost to ensure that Maya&rsquo;s Hope performs its mission and achieves its goals. Principal Commitments Act with integrity and represent the interests of all people served by the organization. Recognize that decisions of the board can be made only by a majority vote at a) a board meeting or b) in writing. Respect the majority decisions of the board. Participate in: Board self-evaluation programs. Board development workshops, seminars, and other educational events that enhance skills as a board member. Handle information with discretion and confidentiality as necessary. Exercise authority as a board member only when acting in a meeting with the full board or as delegated by the board with members. Collaborate with members who serve this board and leave personal prejudices out of all board discussions. Represent Maya&rsquo;s Hope in a positive and supportive manner at all times. Display courteous conduct at all board and committee meetings. Refrain from intruding on administrative issues that are the responsibility of management, except to monitor the results of the organization. Monitor the financial condition of the organization. Understand and comply with the bylaws of Maya&rsquo;s Hope. Avoid conflicts of interest between my position as a board member and my personal or professional life (as referenced in Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s Conflict of Interest Policy.) If such a conflict does arise, I will disclose that conflict to the board and refrain from voting on matters in which I have conflict. Liability of Board Members As a fully incorporated non-profit, Maya&rsquo;s Hope enjoys the same limited liability that any corporation does. Corporations offer the protection of limited liability to corporate directors and officers. Limited liability means that the organization's directors and officers have limited personal liability for business debts. Generally, creditors can only go after corporate assets and insurance to satisfy liabilities incurred by the corporation. This principle applies, however, only when the board has fulfilled its basic duties, such as the duty of care. A board member is legally bound to exercise reasonable care when he or she makes a decision for the organization. Reasonable care is what an 'ordinarily prudent' person in a similar situation would do. Examples of when a board member may have personal liability include (but are not limited to) when a board member: personally and directly injures someone. personally guarantees a bank loan or a business debt on which the corporation defaults, or behaves in a fraudulent or illegal manner that causes harm, Maya&rsquo;s Hope maintains a Directors & Officers liability insurance policy. Responsibilities of Secretary: Meeting Minutes The primary task of the secretary of an executive board is to record and maintain the minutes of each board meeting. Meeting minutes are detail reports that highlight the predetermined agenda of each conference as well as what actually took place. For example, a secretary may notate the following: \\\"The meeting began at 11 a.m. The first order of business was for the president to discuss potential changes to the organization&rsquo;s mission statement; however, he was unable to attend the gathering due to medical reasons. The issue was put on hold until a later date.\\\" Record Maintenance As the custodian of corporate records, the secretary of an executive board must maintain all company files in a manner compliant with organizational policies as well as any laws that regulate the industry. These documents may include the firm&rsquo;s article of incorporation, bylaws and employee contact lists, as well as financial records. He must also develop and enforce policies regarding access to these confidential files. Security controls, such as who can access which files and what approvals are needed to do so, are examples of the many procedures he must implement. Depending on the industry in which the company does business, the secretary of the executive board may be required to file certain documents with the government. For example, a nonprofit organization must meet certain criteria to maintain its tax-exempt status. It is often the responsibility of the secretary to ensure that all necessary paperwork is completed and returned to the Internal Revenue Service. Organizational Representative It is not uncommon for the secretary of an executive board to serve as its signing officer. This designation gives her the authority to sign documents, such as contracts, checks and credit applications, on behalf of the organization. Because this responsibility wields so much power, many firms implement a system of checks and balances so it is not abused. For instance, before signing a service agreement, the secretary may need the express written permission of two other board members. She must follow these guidelines or risk termination and, in severe cases, criminal prosecution.", "title": "Board Member Opening at Maya's Hope", "zipcode": "10001", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D2862432%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "Maya's Hope"}, {"end": null, "description": "As a Seed Coach you will form a one-to-one advising relationship with a young woman of color to transform her passion and dreams into a powerful story for her resume and college essay.

A pioneering nonprofit, Heifer International, has shown that nonprofits can capture some of that money by making donations, given in a friend&rsquo;s name, feel like a present. It works! They raise $115 million a year this way. Imagine how much more gift money could be captured by nonprofits addressing popular causes, including your favorites. The challenge is that it is too daunting for most nonprofits to provide a gift-like experience: tangible donation opportunities, wish lists, gift registries, and personalized printed greeting cards. About www.ChangingThePresent.org Our nonprofit site provides a gift-like experience, which helps 400 leading nonprofits capture money normally spent on traditional presents. The NY Times called it an \\\"amazon.com of the nonprofit world.\\\" We are now about to invite all million nonprofits to join the site. We are also providing each with their own private, charitable gift sites so they can send supporters without exposing them to other nonprofits. See a sample: http://SampleNGO.GiftsForHumanity.org. We facilitate this type of giving for individuals and nonprofits, and we promote this as a social norm. The Environment This is a great place to work. We have interns and volunteers from all over the United States and all around the world. The atmosphere is energetic, creative, and fun. We value brainstorming, initiative, sharing, and collaborating. Think of it is a laboratory, studio, seminar, or incubator. We are also casual.

Here is an opportunity to help underprivileged children, to help under-served children, to help ALL children, and even to help adults who can't read. We are looking for three, very special people, who have the skills, expertise, experience, passion, and time to be part of something amazing that is about to fundamentally change the lives of millions of children, who right now, have no hope, but who will soon have the opportunity to learn how to read, which, in turn, will open a window to education and to a world of potential for them that, not only, has never been opened before, but that has never even been seriously contemplated as a possible reality, as opposed to just a pipe dream or a fantasy. What we are talking about is an adaptive learning, smartphone app, that can literally, teach a child to read in about 12 hours of total use time! We are the American Youth Literacy Foundation, and we have been teaching children how to read for 11 years! We have been developing this app for about two years, and our goal is to launch this incredible smartphone app in the App Store and on Google Play by Thanksgiving of 2020! We are partnered with an engineering team that was one of the five $1 million finalists in the XPrize for Global Learning competition, the winners of which were announced this past May, which was a worldwide competition for app design and development teams from around the world to design, build and deliver a tablet-based app to children in remote villages in Africa which could teach them how to read and do basic math (children of all ages, most of whom had never been to school before in their lives). The curriculum that our app is based on is a patented reading decoding system, and is so effective at teaching children how to read, that it usually only takes 4-6 hours for them to understand the system, and another 4-6 hours for them to reach a 2nd grade reading level. Compare this to many of our students who have been in the public school system for 6 years and still can't spell the word \\\"the.\\\" Compare this to millions of students who have dropped out of school, primarily because they can't read (more than 10 million per decade). More than 20 million children in grades 3-12 in America's public schools today can't read! Our organization is an 11 year old, nationwide, charitable 501 c 3 non-profit. We started out as a tutoring program and we still tutor. But our focus has always been on finding a scaleable solution to the literacy crisis in America. With the rise of the smartphone and the amazing penetration of this powerful tool, even into the most impoverished communities, we feel that the answer we have been searching for IS in the form of an app. So for the past several years we have been working to convert our amazing reading curriculum that teaches children how to read in 12 hours, into an app that teaches children how to read in 12 hours. And this is where you come in. We have a LOT of opportunity in front of us to build, test, and deliver an end user experience (the UX) to millions of children in America's inner cities and rural lands, to the barrios and the suburbs and American Indian reservations and everywhere in-between, with this smartphone app. But in order to do this, we need to complete three pieces of the equation: The Horse, The Cart, and the Payload. The Horse is the curriculum; and it is well under way in the conversion process from analog to a digital pedagogy. The Cart is the distribution system, the \\\"how do we get it out into communities and to the children, once it's built?\\\" And the Payload is the UX (the user experience). But it's not just the child(who is the ultimate end user), but it's the parent or guardian or friend, or grandparent or sibling or concerned adult who must also be supported. And for that we are building the support system and the support network that will scale with the app and not constrain the growth and penetration of the app. The UX must be tested and must be proven to work in a controlled environment before it is released into an uncontrolled environment like the App Store or Google Play, where its success will depend upon ease of use, ease of understanding and the support that we provide to caring adults who download the app for the purpose of saving their child from living a life of impoverishment, without education, and without hope. All of this development, whether it's the curriculum, the distribution system or the user experience, takes graphic design production and support. Building our curriculum and testing it in the field requires raw, pdf draft versions of the app that can be downloaded by tutors across the country working with kids, then modified as needed before they are enshrined in html and javascript code for the digital experience. Marketing and distribution require graphic support and materials. The UX support system for caring adults requires information and digital tools that contain critical information that is presented in an easy to use format. There's much more to tell. You can read more about our story and about us on our website at www.YouthLit.org. All of this requires Adobe Suite support, so right now we are looking for 3 very special people to be a part of our Lead Design Team. We are looking for 3 very special people who have everything we mentioned above, passion, expertise, time, etc. to join our team and help us launch this app in 2020. Our 3 person, Lead Design Team will help us design and build multiple curriculum, as well as marketing and support materials that are critical to the app's success! The Lead Design Team will hire future designers for specific tasking as needed. If you are interested in becoming a \\\"task specific\\\" graphic design team member, please also contact us and we will file your resume appropriately for a later date. If you wish to be considered for this opportunity to be a member of our Lead Design Team, please send us a cover letter and resume to info@YouthLit.org. We are looking for intelligent, creative, enthusiastic, cheerful, optimistic individuals with significant experience in both digital and print media. We are looking for hands on, \\\"can do\\\" individuals who are willing to execute production tasks. We are looking for designers who have extensive experience in Adobe Creative Suite. This is a complex undertaking and we are looking for highly proficient and organized individuals to help build the materials needed for an effective product launch, and to hire and coordinate other individuals who likely will be needed to fill in the gaps and complete critical projects in support of the app. Just to be clear, our organization is an extended, virtual network, comprised of individuals around the country who collaborate through digital, internet-based tools. Individuals interested in this position should have experience organizing tasking across a variety of networks and platforms. Thank you! We hope this opportunity finds you at the right place and the right time in your career to make a difference and an impact, in an amazing way, for millions of children who are waiting for someone, or some thing, to lead them out of a life of impoverishment and into a future of unlimited possibility and potential.

Volunteer Opportunities: Companionship Volunteers work directly with patients providing companionship, offering friendly visits, reading to patients, writing letters, offering a gentle touch or sharing a quiet moment. Complementary Volunteers are certified/trained professionals who can provide complementary modalities of reflexology, music, imagery and touch therapies such as Reiki, massage, therapeutic touch and healing hands. Pet Therapy Volunteers provide certified/trained pets who visit with patients. These animals provide loving memories for some and give unconditional love helping our patients feel connected to a larger world. Administrative Volunteers provide help to the staff in our Edison office by assisting with typing, addressing cards, organizing newsletters, creating packets, collating manuals and other varied clerical duties Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, huggable dolls/bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Junior Volunteers consist of groups such as girl/boy scouts or young people who wish to honor our patients by making holiday cards, posters, wall hangings and memory books. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families and friends of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network.

All tutors are also expected to complete a four session comprehensive, professional training regimen. 6 hours of live training, plus another hour and a half for orientation. This is a commitment of 7.5 hours of in person training, and 4 hours of supplemental training for a total of 11.5 hours of training over the course of the Fall semester. If you have prior tutoring or teaching experience, only 4.5 hours of live training are required. Training days will be determined based on your schedule and that of the Tutor Training Coordinators. CT's tutoring program has been successful in helping students gain access to support that they otherwise would not have received, given their limited time spent on campus. Having a tutor in the class early in the semester will allow us to employ strategies to reduce withdrawals and student failure rates.

Grace Healthcare Services is a Hospice organization that cares for patients throughout NJ. Veterans at the end of life. Volunteers are an essential component of this care. WHY A NEED FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS? -Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect to patients who have served our country. -Veterans share a common bond and code of conduct. -The camaraderie that exists between Veterans has proven to be a great support for the Veterans we care for. As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee. Please help us honor our Veterans by giving them the gift of your time. If you are interested or have questions please contact the Grace Healthcare Services Volunteer Department at 732-225-4100 ext. 138 to inquire about the Veteran-to-Veteran Volunteer Program.

Feel free to also check us out on our website to learn more about us at www.TEACH4Kids.org Who We Are: TEACH (Together Educating All Children in Hospitals) is an international not-for-profit organization that brings exciting, hands-on, STEM educational programming to children in hospitals. Our mission is to create an outlet for children of all ages to passionately engage with the sciences through the medium of fun, interactive experiments. Through engagement with practical science concepts, the children are challenged yet empowered. They emerge comforted and confident, encouraged to successfully cope with the trials that lie before them. TEACH modules challenge children to think creatively and bring an element of fun to an otherwise monotonous day. When TEACH volunteers visit, children get excited and get to experience STEM topics through more than 75 different interactive modules. Patients can learn about real life concepts while also having an exceptional amount of fun. They are amazed as they create silly putty while they learn about polymers and use basic engineering principles to build boats that really float. Observing the science of physiological respiration using yeast to inflate a balloon or discovering density by creating their very own lava lamps truly changes the way they view science, their stay in the hospital and life. What makes us special is that TEACH was founded by and is entirely run by students. In Spring 2013, TEACH&rsquo;s two co-founders were inspired to help with the need for interaction and activity, the craving for a personal bond, and the lack of mental and physical stimulation exhibited by hospitalized children. Under the mentorship and guidance of Dr. Edward Burns of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, TEACH was created to heal through teaching. TEACH began with monthly modules in a local Bronx hospital. In just over a year, TEACH grew to reach nine hospitals with hundreds of students signed up to volunteer from various universities around the tristate area. We have served over 3000 children, 30 hospitals internationally, and 1000 volunteers. What TEACH Needs TEACH is seeking an enthusiastic and passionate individual that wants to make a difference in the lives of medically ill children. We need someone who is committed to the organization both in the time they commit to as well as a financial responsibility to support the organization. Our Advisory board members are required to be active within the organization and play a significant role in the growth of the organization. Advisory Board Member Responsibilities TEACH Advisory board will meet periodically and communicates via email and phone at various times throughout the year. Advisory Board members are required to assist fundraising efforts and participate in at least one committee. Some of the things that they would need to participate in would be to promote events, participate in peer to peer campaigns, help with corporate partnerships and networking.
