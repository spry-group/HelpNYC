We avoid all processed food including milled grains and sugar. Suppers meetings involve whole food preparation, eating the meal, running food experiments to help people determine their personal best way of eating, and an educational piece which is usually driven by the special interests of the facilitator. They can be general or specific to a population, like people with diabetes or digestive issues or people who just want to learn healthy food preparation like mothers who want to feed their kids better. Meals can be vegan, vegetarian or omnivore. After you have the initial training, the volunteer obligation is about 2 hours a month for facilitator meetings and 5 hours per month of service (or 5 hours per week for weekly meetings). The training is free for people who start Suppers meetings and a nominal cost for those who just want the training. Check out www.TheSuppersPrograms.org .

Whether you choose to work directly with patients and families or to volunteer in one of many other ways, you can make a profound difference in someone's life, including your own. Volunteers are an integral part of the hospice team. Volunteer Opportunities: Companionship Volunteers work directly with patients providing companionship, offering friendly visits, reading to patients, writing letters, offering a gentle touch or sharing a quiet moment. Complementary Volunteers are certified/trained professionals who can provide complementary modalities of reflexology, music, imagery and touch therapies such as Reiki, massage, therapeutic touch and healing hands. Pet Therapy Volunteers provide certified/trained pets who visit with patients. These animals provide loving memories for some and give unconditional love helping our patients feel connected to a larger world. Administrative Volunteers provide help to the staff in our Edison office by assisting with typing, addressing cards, organizing newsletters, creating packets, collating manuals and other varied clerical duties Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, huggable dolls/bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Junior Volunteers consist of groups such as girl/boy scouts or young people who wish to honor our patients by making holiday cards, posters, wall hangings and memory books. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families and friends of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network. Hospice training classes are required for Companionship and Complementary Volunteers. They are free of charge and offered on an ongoing basis.

Each week there are hundreds of animal rescue transports taking place where animals are moved from high-kill shelters to no-kill shelters and rescue organizations, as well as foster homes and adopters. It's easy for you to get involved and help save more animals simply by driving a leg in this relay. How it works: 1. Sign-up on Doobert.com or use the Facebook plug-in (search for \\\" Doobert Rescue\\\" on Facebook) and specify the days you're available, the distance you're willing to drive, and then sit back and we'll do the rest. 2. When an animal rescue organization posts a transport request, the system will automatically search to see if it matches your profile (if you're available and within the distance) and then it automatically sends you an e-mail. 3. Then you simply click on the leg that you can cover and everyone else will see that you've signed up for that leg. 4. You'll get communications from the transport coordinator and, once the transport is a \\\"go\\\", you simply drive to the meeting place, load up the animals, and drive them to the next meeting place to hand them off to the next volunteer. You'll get plenty of doggy kisses and thank you's along the way as the animals know you are there to help them.

Sprout is a non-profit organization based in New York City focused on providing innovative programs for adults with developmental disabilities.With our network of resources and dedicated volunteers, which we call leaders, Sprout opens up fascinating new worlds to people with disabilities. Sprout's Overnight Vacations Program is looking for individuals who have the energy, motivation and desire to work with adults with developmental disabilities. What do Sprout leaders do? Sprout leaders' primary goal is to give adults with developmental disabilities the opportunity to experience and enjoy recreational, educational and leisure activities through overnight vacations. Leaders are responsible for the overall safety and enjoyment of their group, 24 hours a day, while on a Sprout trip. Duties include safety monitoring, personal hygiene assistance, providing physical and emotional support, activity planning, budgeting, logistics, and enhancing fun. The work is hard yet immensely rewarding as you develop leadership skills and gain insight into your own abilities. What type of training is provided? Leaders must complete a pre-service training, which provides the necessary procedures and tools to run a successful and enjoyable vacation. Leaders who are drivers receive extra training on how to safely drive our 15-passenger vans. In addition, all leaders receive a copy of Sprout's Leadership Handbook to help with policies and guidelines. What is the time commitment? Sprout vacations last 3 - 7 days depending on the time of year and destination of the trip. When a leader is selected for an overnight vacation, Sprout asks that the leader dedicate themselves to stay with their group throughout the entire duration of the vacation. Some leaders only choose to lead one trip a year while others spend several months with us leading up to 8 trips or more. Sprout strives to make our program flexible for our leaders based on the amount of time leaders can give. Do leaders have any free or personal time while on a trip? Sprout trips are working vacations for the leaders who choose to participate. Because Sprout leaders are responsible for their group 24 hours a day, there is no free or personal time allotted. In order to give our participants the opportunity to experience and enjoy a vacation, Sprout leaders must be available at all times to provide the support any one participant may need. What type of trips can Sprout leaders expect to join? A majority of Sprout trips take place within a day's drive of New York City. Destinations include Atlantic City, Amish Country, Boston, Lake George, Cleveland, Maine and Virginia Beach. Exotic trips like cruises, Hawaii, and Europe are presented to leaders who have demonstrated high levels of commitment, service hours and have gained positive feedback from participants and Sprout office staff. Are there any special skills or requirements? No special background or education is required to become a Sprout leader. We encourage people from all cultures and professions, and of all ethnic and educational backgrounds. Once accepted into the program, you will receive the necessary tools to sign up for outings and how to assist our participants. Requirements include: -21+ years old -Provide references -Participate in training session -Willingness to complete necessary background checks -Evaluate participants' behavior -Fluent English -Willing to drive a 15 passenger van -Love to travel & have fun!

Each week there are hundreds of animal rescue transports taking place where animals are moved from high-kill shelters to no-kill shelters and rescue organizations, as well as foster homes and adopters. It's easy for you to get involved and help save more animals simply by driving a leg in this relay. How it works: 1. Sign-up on Doobert.com or use the Facebook plug-in (search for \\\" Doobert Rescue\\\" on Facebook) and specify the days you're available, the distance you're willing to drive, and then sit back and we'll do the rest. 2. When an animal rescue organization posts a transport request, the system will automatically search to see if it matches your profile (if you're available and within the distance) and then it automatically sends you an e-mail. 3. Then you simply click on the leg that you can cover and everyone else will see that you've signed up for that leg. 4. You'll get communications from the transport coordinator and, once the transport is a \\\"go\\\", you simply drive to the meeting place, load up the animals, and drive them to the next meeting place to hand them off to the next volunteer. You'll get plenty of doggy kisses and thank you's along the way as the animals know you are there to help them.

Hunger is not something many of us know much about. For most Americans, we eat when and where we want; our options are virtually unlimited. In addition, if we do think about hunger, we most often picture people in a land far away from where we live and our most familiar examples closer to home are people without homes and jobs. But hunger happens near us; it happens to families we know, to people with jobs and homes who are trying desperately to make life work. The Numbers A recent report states that 1 in 5 children, aged 5 and under are food insecure; meaning they are unable to consistently access the amounts of nutritious food necessary for a healthy life. Many of these children live in homes with parents who are working and doing their best but coming up short. Often parents in this situation are put in the position of deciding between putting gas in the car to go to work, paying the rent or buying food for their family. Our community partners serving these families state that as a result of the \\\"new normal\\\" our economy has produced, requests for meals and groceries are at an all-time high, while simultaneously donations (both food and fiscal) are slumping. What Can We Do? Community Plates would like to first open a window to see some of these people who live close to us and then provide a platform to make a difference in their lives. Families shouldn't have to make these kinds of decisions and don't have to go hungry. Children shouldn't worry about where their next meal is coming from. While food insecure people go hungry, according to numerous studies Americans throw away between 25 and 40 percent of our food supply. It happens in our homes, restaurants, stores and farms. CommunityPlates exists to get that surplus food from the trash can, dumpsters and landfills to where it can make a difference in shelters, soup kitchens, food banks and food pantries. This platform is a toolbox of information and we focus on training, technology, and coordination to make volunteering and donating as simple and effective as possible. We're not saying that ending unnecessary hunger in our communities will be easy, but we do believe that all of our small efforts when combined form something substantial Mission Statement Our mission is to end food insecurity in the United States!", "title": "Hunger in the US makes no sense-help us end food insecurity-become a food runner", "zipcode": "06850", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D1576787%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "Food Rescue US"}, {"end": null, "description": "Protect our environment and the special place in which we live!

WSOS is the only volunteer group in the county that delivers free services to help adults 60plus achieve a better understanding of Medicare health plans, prescription drug coverage, and other benefits available to seniors - saving them time and money. We serve over 12,000 senior citizens annually. Currently we have over 75 volunteers. They are all ages and claim diverse interests, talents and origins. They have backgrounds in health care, law, business, education, the arts and more. While many of our volunteers are retired, some continue to work and all contribute their time on a flexible schedule that meets their needs. WSOS meet monthly to participate in training from subject specialists, which includes the Medicare Rights Center. Our volunteers are comfortable using computers, have excellent interpersonal skills, and are able to provide 6-12 hours per month of consistent service. Volunteers engage in one or more of the following programs: Medicare Minute Offers brief, engaging, actionable information on specific aspects of Medicare. Volunteers present this information on a monthly basis to older adults at various sites throughout Westchester County. Following the presentation, volunteers remain to privately answer personal questions and concerns. A volunteer Medicare Minute Presenter is assigned a community center and is responsible for each month&rsquo;s Medicare Minute. A script, teaching materials and handouts are provided by WSOS through an agreement with the Medicare Rights Center. Additionally, brief information on other services of interest to seniors is offered. The Health Advocacy Players (HAP) In HAP, volunteers partner to present entertaining, interactive presentations on Medicare topics at senior centers, residences, clubs, libraries and aging-in-place communities. HAP&rsquo;s 60 minute long programs consist of scripted stories, scenes, and monologues on a specific Medicare topic, followed by a question-and-answer period. If you like acting, a bit of improvisation, and thinking on your feet, HAP is for you. Senior Benefit Information Centers (SBIC) Volunteers have the opportunity to become a Senior Benefits Counselor at one of our centers operating in public libraries. As an SBIC counselor, you provide seniors with information about their health care insurance choices, various federal and state financial assistance programs, and provide help with related Medicare issues. SBICs are a walk-in service that also is supported by an email and telephone hotline. The walk-in sites include New Rochelle, Peekskill, Port Chester, Shrub Oak, Tarrytown, and Yonkers. In addition to the opportunities described above, experienced volunteers are invited to support the delivery of presentations and workshops on related health care issues such as Medicare/ Medicaid dual eligibility and health care proxies.

Grace Healthcare Services is a Community-based Hospice program that cares for Veterans at the end of life. Volunteers are an essential component of this care. WHY A NEED FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS? -Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect to patients who have served our country. -Veterans share a common bond and code of conduct. -The camaraderie that exists between Veterans has proven to be a great support for the Veterans we care for. As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee.

Often, regularly scheduled visits are requested, however Music Volunteers may also be asked to provide musical visits on an occasional basis for one patient/family or for a group of patients at a facility as outreach for the local hospice agency. Hospice is built on the philosophy that we care for our patients in mind, body and soul. Administrative Volunteers provide help in our Cranford office by assisting with typing, addressing cards, organizing newsletters, creating packets, collating manuals and other varied clerical duties Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, memory bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network. They often make phone calls to check up on family members and also send cards of comfort and care.

The Oxfam Action Corps aimed to right the wrongs of poverty, hunger, and injustice. Oxfam Action Corps embodied the campaigns and efforts of Oxfam America&rsquo;s work. Our volunteer organizers across the United States have lobbied our elected officials in nationwide efforts, campaigned in our communities for international food companies to improve their policies, an ... d canvassed to educate and empower. Hundreds of lobby visits were conducted, tens of thousands of signatures were collected, and over twenty campaigns were championed, all culminating in an unstoppable momentum of people power. Equally important are the relationships fostered through our efforts. As we grew our networks, we strengthened our forces to mobilize for human rights. Recently Oxfam announced that in response to changing global realities, Oxfam is restructuring internationally, which means the end of the official Oxfam Action Corps program; however, we the volunteers and grassroots organizers choose to continue and expand upon our work under a new a banner: Action Corps. We choose to persevere and continue our mission. As we embark on this new chapter, we commit to creating positive change in our world and believe we can end poverty in our lifetime regardless of the challenges we may face. We ask each of you to continue to stand for global economic justice and the human right to food. Whatever your background, career, ethnicity, gender, join us in our mission -- We are Action Corps. \\\"Small acts, when multiplied by millions of people, can transform the world.\\\" Howard Zinn", "title": "Concert Outreach with Oxfam", "zipcode": "10016", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D2448493%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "Action Corps"}, {"end": null, "description": "For over 28 years, the Volunteer Referral Center has helped thousands of New Yorkers find great volunteer opportunities.

Graphic Design Internship at ClassWish.org! Work in NYC or Virtually We are recruiting outstanding graphic design students as interns for late Summer 2012 and the 2012-2013 school year (either or both!) to collaborate on the boldest nonprofit initiative we know. We are looking for passionate, energetic students with exceptional skills to create web page layouts, flyers, logos, etc. for ClassWish.org. This is an outstanding leadership opportunity in an innovative start-up nonprofit organization. Here is the problem we are tackling: K-12 schools in this country do not have enough resources to let children explore their potential and excel. Art supplies, books, computers, musical instruments, science equipment, sports equipment, and even paper for computers and printers are all in desperately short supply. Our Approach: ClassWish . org, an exciting new nonprofit, uses modern business practices and the latest marketing techniques to help 125,000 schools serving 56 million kids, inform, inspire and engage supporters. Teachers visit the site to create Wish Lists of the resources they need. People in the community can see exactly what is needed and contribute to help. About Us: The people behind ClassWish.org include such prominent education and business leaders as Adam Hirsch, former COO, Mashable; Laurie Coots, CMO, TBWA; Scott Cutler, EVP, New York Stock Exchange; Betsy Morgan, former CEO, Huffington Post; Nancy Pelz-Paget, Director, Education and Society Program, Aspen Institute; Sharon Robinson, CEO, American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education. Forbes Magazine liked our approach so much that they donated a full page to help raise awareness. Yo-Yo Ma, Tony Hawk and Dwight Howard are among the celebrities who have offered to help promote ClassWish.org. The work: Teachers and students are already getting supplies from ClassWish.org. Now, we need to develop attention-grabbing graphics so we can help more kids. You will take a leadership role and work with other highly motivated interns, established professionals, and directly with our co-founder. What do we offer? You will enhance your portfolio with projects that will be displayed on the Internet as well as in print, visible to potential future employers, and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you have helped children get the tools they need to perform at their best. If you want to gain great experience and do something you will always be proud of, send a cover letter and a resume to interns @ ClassWish . org. Impress us. This is competitive. FAQ Is this a business or a nonprofit? ClassWish is a nonprofit, but we use the latest techniques from the business world to make a leveraged, scalable and financially-self sustaining difference in the lives of tens of millions of children. This sounds ambitious! Daniel Burnham, the great Chicago architect, said \\\"Make no little plans; they have not the power to stir men&rsquo;s souls.\\\" (Nor women&rsquo;s, we hasten to add). Little plans also do not have the power to provide a better education to 56 million kids who deserve more than they are getting today. We face a crushing need in schools, have a solid plan to address it, and with your help, we intend to grow this very large and very fast. Where are you located? We are in Manhattan, conveniently located right across from Madison Square Garden. There are four express subway stops within one block. We will also hire interns to work remotely from other cities. I looked at your site and have some suggestions. Great! This is a collaborative project, and we want to hear from you. Is this a paid internship? We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your portfolio, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions. When will you select the interns? We&rsquo;re agile. When we see a great candidate, we extend an invitation immediately. We won&rsquo;t keep you waiting for a decision. What dates will the internship run? We are hiring for the spring semester, for the summer, and beyond. Tell us what you are looking for. What are the hours? We welcome full-time and part-time interns. Let us know what works for you. What will I need to bring?

In becoming a CASA volunteer you will become the voice for a child in a court proceeding, which often overlooks the wants, needs and desires of the child. Every year more than half a million abused and neglected children are in need of safe, permanent, nurturing homes. Too many spend years moving from one temporary home to another. They are more likely than other children to face homelessness, unemployment, even prison as adults. That's why Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) for children are important. CASA was created to make sure the abuse and neglect these children originally suffered at home doesn't continue as abuse and neglect at the hands of the system. As trained advocates, CASA volunteers are appointed by judges to be a voice for these children in court. The result is that a child is placed into a safe, loving home where he/she can thrive. CASA of Union County is currently recruiting for our Spring 2017 class of volunteer advocates. These volunteers will receive intensive training to equip them with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate their way through the court and child welfare systems. They will learn how to advocate for the best interest of children and make sure that the children receive the services and assistance necessary to ensure that they move as quickly as possible toward safe and permanent homes. Please note: No legal or social service experience is required, but you must be 21 years of age. The CASA training is approximately thirty hours, and the volunteer is required to make an eighteen month commitment. By law, volunteers must have a full criminal background check and fingerprint check, as well as a screening interview before beginning training.

Four-month-old Bosley is a puppy with a special mission. One day, he will provide enhanced independence and mobility to a person with disabilities - whether they're blind or visually impaired, or have a disability other than blindness. But Bosley isn't growing up at the Guide Dog Foundation for the Blind. Each year, the Guide Dog Foundation breeds about 300 exceptional puppies, and it's vital that Bosley and other pups like him spend the first year of their lives with surrounded by the love and security of volunteer foster families called puppy walkers. Puppy walkers help Foundation puppies grow up to be confident dogs. What's involved in raising a Guide Dog Foundation puppy? Bosley went to live with his puppy walkers when he was about nine weeks old. He's learning basic obedience and social skills while being exposed to many different situations. People who raise Guide Dog Foundation puppies say it is the most rewarding thing they've ever done. Puppy raisers come from everywhere - stay-at-home moms or dads, teachers, college students, retirees, people with flexible work environments - and are crucial members of the Guide Dog Foundation family. By opening their hearts and homes to a puppy, a puppy raiser plays a crucial role in helping a person with disabilities live an independent life. Every puppy walker family works with a Guide Dog Foundation puppy adviser, who is available to answer questions and offer guidance and support. When he is about 14 months old, Bosley will return to the Guide Dog Foundation's Smithtown campus to begin his training as a guide or service dog. Puppy raisers will admit it's tough to say good-bye, but when they see the pup they raised take its place at the side of someone with disabilities, the ache they feel turns pride. There are puppies waiting now to join your loving home for a chance to start their careers.

Since then, similar events have been held in Pakistan, Paris, Luxembourg, West Africa, Florida, Netherlands, Massachusetts, Australia, Iceland, England and Stockholm. We currently have distributed over 750,000 stickers. In 2011, the Project began working with children at The Earth School in NYC. Team members helped youngsters (ages 5-12) make origami hearts and facilitated discussions about what it means to 'love yourself&rsquo;. The origami hearts were featured in the \\\"1,000 Hearts\\\"Exhibition. To create the \\\"1,000 Hearts\\\"exhibition, the team collected 1,000 hand-folded origami hearts from people all around the world.

Here are some of the activities we've done: * Collected toiletry donations, packed bags and distributed them to the homeless * Conducted job readiness and life skill workshops for at-risk teens; served as mentors and employment coaches * Served on advisory boards; boards of directors; focus groups for community based organizations to address areas of concern * Raised funds and/or awareness for an array of charities / Raised funds for families and individuals undergoing crisis * Participated in peace walks, rallies and other advocacy efforts around an array of justice issues * Facilitated school supply, toy and coat drives * Developed opportunities for our members to showcase their own businesses, projects, events and causes. * Collaborated with other community based organizations on advocacy and social justice programs. * Send birthday cards to children who have experienced crisis. * Lobbied political leaders for change in our local and global communities. Some of the social activities we've done have included - * Unlimited basketball team * Bowling Group * Dance / Step Team * Tournament of Champions * Memorial Day Weekend Trips to Myrtle Beach * Robust social media groups that expose members to other members around the world. * Annual business/service trip to New Jersey * Annual resume/business plan review for members Annually, the organization convenes in New Jersey for its conference which includes a recognition ceremony, vendor promotion, entrepreneur's luncheon and dinner dance. On Memorial Day weekend 2018, the plan is to convene in North Carolina for our annual family vacation. The Brotherhood can expect to do virtual projects over the summer months and will plan a meeting schedule that works for the majority. Those who are unable to attend meetings can still work virtually. In addition to our social and service efforts, after six months of membership, we also help our members develop strong resumes/cover letters, look for jobs (if unemployed) and we serve as references for them. For those who own their own businesses, we promote their businesses/events/organizations on our social media pages as much as we can. A working email address is a requirement as is a Facebook account (you may create a separate one just for this activity if you'd like). The Facebook account is critical as it allows you to participate in discussions and activities with members from all over the world. Our pledge process is very simple, it is basically an orientation that is done virtually (via Facebook) and there is no form of hazing observed. If you do not have Facebook and are not willing to create a page for this opportunity, then there is no way that you can help us at this time. Interested candidates can complete the inquiry form at http://souldeevas.wixsite.com/neos/adult-membership or respond here with your name, age and neighborhood of residence. We will then forward the membership application. There are no dues required for those who apply under this opportunity but the summer pledge class is the last class where we will offer volunteer membership. Orientations begin on either June 26th or July 3rd. There are eight slots available.", "title": "Nu Sigma Theta- The Brotherhood", "zipcode": "10001", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D2716943%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "Friends of MJHS"}, {"end": null, "description": "Finance Internship with ChangingThePresent.org to Make a Difference!

Enhance your resume and get a glowing letter of recommendation. About ChangingThePresent.org The New York Times called ChangingThePresent.org an \\\"amazon.com of the nonprofit world\\\" for our work in helping 400 leading nonprofits capture money normally spent on traditional presents. At the same time that a million nonprofits desperately need more funds to accomplish their missions, Americans spend $450 billion a year on birthday, holiday, and other presents. Most of those presents are not very rewarding. Tons of sweaters, fuzzy slippers, and ties end up in the dark corners of our closets. It is no surprise that a growing number of people, who seek meaning more than things, are starting to show their love by donating in a friend&rsquo;s name in lieu of giving traditional presents. The challenge for nonprofits is that it is simply too daunting to provide the requisite gift-like experience (tangible charitable gifts, wish lists and registries, and personalized printed greeting cards) that can make a donation feel like a rewarding gift. ChangingThePresent.org provides those tools to facilitate this type of giving for nonprofits and donors. What You Will Do: Philanthropic Funding research and management. For each of 100 causes, we are researching potential philanthropic funders (individuals, corporations, and foundations) that might provide growth funding. Each dollar they provide, and which we invest in enhancing and marketing the site, is likely to generate a multiple of new dollars for the cause from money that would otherwise have been spent on fuzzy slippers and giant cans of popcorn. This provides them a rare opportunity to leverage their philanthropic dollars to make a greater impact. Casual and Friendly Office Environment This is a great place to work. We have had interns and volunteers from all over the United States and more than fifty countries. The atmosphere is energetic, creative, and fun. We value brainstorming, initiative, sharing, and collaborating. Think of it is a laboratory, studio, seminar, or incubator. We are also casual.

About ChangingThePresent.org The New York Times called ChangingThePresent.org an \\\"amazon.com of the nonprofit world\\\" for our work in helping 400 leading nonprofits capture money normally spent on traditional presents. At the same time that a million nonprofits desperately need more funds to accomplish their missions, Americans spend $450 billion a year on birthday, holiday, and other presents. Most of those presents are not very rewarding. Tons of sweaters, fuzzy slippers, and ties end up in the dark corners of our closets. It is no surprise that a growing number of people, who seek meaning more than things, are starting to show their love by donating in a friend&rsquo;s name in lieu of giving traditional presents. The challenge for nonprofits is that it is simply too daunting to provide the requisite gift-like experience (tangible charitable gifts, wish lists and registries, and personalized printed greeting cards) that can make a donation feel like a rewarding gift. ChangingThePresent.org provides those tools to facilitate this type of giving for nonprofits and donors. We are about to take ChangingThePresent to the next level. That involves expanding from the initial 400 organizations to invite all 1.1 million nonprofits; adding additional causes and categories.

Use your skills, experience, knowledge, creativity and talent to improve the lives of millions. Help us capture for nonprofits - or other causes you care about -some of the $250 billion Americans spend each year buying presents. Become a member of our dynamic and creative international team, and become a leader among those who care for the same causes as you do. Help us grow a movement to facilitate and encourage a new type of meaningful giving through direct engagement of nonprofits, foundations, associations, thought leaders, media, and celebrities. Work from our Manhattan office or remotely. Enhance your resume and get a glowing letter of recommendation. About ChangingThePresent.org The New York Times called ChangingThePresent.org an \\\"amazon.com of the nonprofit world\\\" for our work in helping 400 leading nonprofits capture money normally spent on traditional presents. At the same time that a million nonprofits desperately need more funds to accomplish their missions, Americans spend $450 billion a year on birthday, holiday, and other presents. Most of those presents are not very rewarding. Tons of sweaters, fuzzy slippers, and ties end up in the dark corners of our closets. It is no surprise that a growing number of people, who seek meaning more than things, are starting to show their love by donating in a friend&rsquo;s name in lieu of giving traditional presents. The challenge for nonprofits is that it is simply too daunting to provide the requisite gift-like experience (tangible charitable gifts, wish lists and registries, and personalized printed greeting cards) that can make a donation feel like a rewarding gift. ChangingThePresent.org provides those tools to facilitate this type of giving for nonprofits and donors. We are about to take ChangingThePresent to the next level. That involves expanding from the initial 400 organizations to invite all 1.1 million nonprofits; adding additional causes and categories. Within each cause area, we will seek growth funding, invite advisors, recruit nonprofits, use media and social media to raise awareness among the public, and recruit celebrities to lend their voices. Imagine the impact we can make together as more and more people adopt this type of meaningful giving. Focus on Your Favorite Cause or Professional Field As well as HR, we also seek interns interested in each charitable cause and most professional fields, including strategy, partnerships, finance, communications, social media, graphics, research, community management, fundraising, sponsorships, Public Relations (PR), marketing, event management, organizing, and activism.

Take a leadership role on our dynamic and creative international team. Work from our Manhattan office or remotely. Enhance your resume and get a glowing letter of recommendation. The Problem We Address The skyrocketing cost of college textbooks undermines the education and lives of millions of students, who spend an average of $1,300 a year on books and supplies. 70% of them cannot afford books for all their classes. 30% of them are unable to take classes they want, simply because the books are too expensive. Tacked onto student loans, the textbook costs can haunt them for years. We Are Going to Change the Situation Colleges and universities could greatly decrease the cost of textbooks by adopting ten measures, described in the petition below. We are leading a movement to encourage students, faculty, recent graduates, high school students, and parents to advocate for these changes. The Petition Colleges and universities could save students billions of dollars a year on textbooks by adopting these policies. We call on them to: Consider the cost when selecting textbooks. Use free Open Source textbooks whenever possible. Do not require university-specific editions or (unless essential) the latest edition, which undermine the used book market. Refrain from requiring students to purchase expensive access codes for homework assignments and quizzes. Tell students what textbooks are required and what they cost before registration begins so they have time to shop for savings. Have college bookstores transparently serve students, rather than profit off of them. Inform students of scholarships to fund textbooks. Have college libraries put enough textbooks on reserve for in-house use. Support book exchanges for students to trade used books. Establish a standing student-faculty committee dedicated to this issue. A Nonprofit Movement Free The Textbooks is a nonprofit movement.

A pioneering nonprofit, Heifer International, has shown that nonprofits can capture some of that money by making donations, given in a friend&rsquo;s name, feel like a present. It works! They raise $115 million a year this way. Imagine how much more gift money could be captured by nonprofits addressing popular causes, including your favorites. The challenge is that it is too daunting for most nonprofits to provide a gift-like experience: tangible donation opportunities, wish lists, gift registries, and personalized printed greeting cards. About www.ChangingThePresent.org Our nonprofit site provides a gift-like experience, which helps 400 leading nonprofits capture money normally spent on traditional presents. The NY Times called it an \\\"amazon.com of the nonprofit world.\\\" We are now about to invite all million nonprofits to join the site.

Books, computers, art supplies, musical instruments, science equipment, sports equipment, and even paper for computers and printers are all in desperately short supply. Our Approach: ClassWish.org, an exciting new nonprofit, uses modern business practices and the latest marketing techniques to help 125,000 schools serving 56 million kids, inform, inspire and engage supporters. Teachers visit the site to create Wish Lists of the resources they need. People in the community can see exactly what is needed and contribute to help.

This is an outstanding leadership opportunity in an innovative, emerging nonprofit. Here is the problem we are tackling: K-12 schools in this country do not have enough resources for children to explore their potential and excel. Books, computers, art supplies, musical instruments, science equipment, sports equipment, and even paper for computers and printers are all in desperately short supply. Our Approach: ClassWish . org, an exciting nonprofit, uses modern business practices and the latest marketing techniques to help generate funding to provide needed resources to 56 million kids at 125,000 schools. Teachers visit the site to create Wish Lists of the resources they need. People in the community can see exactly what is needed and contribute to help.

Most importantly, current and former interns will offer a great review of ClassWish.org. Fashion: Teachers and students are already getting supplies from ClassWish.org. Now, we need to raise greater awareness and funding so we can encourage more participation and help more kids. The fashion industry is a key element of that. We are engaging with the Fashion industry, as follows: We will invite famous fashion designers to participate in the celebrity section of ClassWish. They will get their own page, where they can lend their voice to providing children with art suppleis and other resources; honor their own favorite teacher; and link to other fashion icons who are doing the same. They will also appear on web banner ads that we design specifically for each of them. We will secure donated ad inventory from fashion magazines, websites, blogs, schools, and retailers. The ClassWish PSA ads will feature the celebrities involved in the program. We will build Cause Marketing and promotional campaigns with fashion brands and retailers. For instance, we are working on one campaign now: 'Win a wardrobe for yourself and one for your favorite teacher.&rsquo; We will seek editorial coverage of the campaign from fashion magazines and websites. We will use social media to reinforce these campaigns. We are a small organization, so we seek outstanding students who can take a leadership role. They will work in small teams and with our co-founder and other professionals. The fashion program is a new one for us, so this is a ground-floor opportunity. The Environment: This is, frankly, a great place to work. We get great interns from all over the country and all over the world, so the atmosphere is energetic, creative, and fun.

We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your rsum, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions. Do check to see if your school offers a stipend program. When will you select the interns? We&rsquo;re agile. When we see a great candidate, we extend an invitation immediately. We won&rsquo;t keep you waiting for a decision. What dates will the internship run? We are flexible. Tell us what you are looking for. What are the hours? We welcome full-time and part-time interns. Let us know what works for you. What will I need to bring? Brains, heart, passion, energy, a notebook computer (as an early-stage nonprofit, we just can&rsquo;t afford to buy dozens of machines), and a passion to make an immediate improvement to the education of tens of millions of children.

We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your resum\u00e9, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions.

Interns will work in small teams focused on such things as: marketing to particular audiences, such as businesses, bloggers, press, educators, moms, religious organizations, civic organizations, unions, nonprofits, authors, soap operas, magazine readers, teens and celebrities marketing around particular school subjects, such as science, music, art, reading and sports marketing around particular promotions (such as http://ClassWish.org/days and http://ClassWish.org/books/124) creating and implementing social media campaigns building and managing relationships with strategic partners such as http://EdRover.com building and leading a national network of volunteers enhancing the website creating graphics and promotional materials You will take leadership on projects and work with other highly motivated interns, established professionals, and directly with our co-founder. What do we offer? You will enhance your resume with a solid record of professional achievement and community service, and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you have helped children get the tools they need to perform at their best. If you want a great experience doing something you will always be proud of, send a cover letter and a resume to interns@ClassWish.org. Impress us. This is competitive. FAQ Is this a business or a nonprofit? ClassWish is a nonprofit, but we use the latest techniques from the business world to make a leveraged, scalable and financially-self sustaining difference in the lives of tens of millions of children. This sounds ambitious! Daniel Burnham, the great Chicago architect, said \\\"Make no little plans; they have not the power to stir men's souls.\\\" (Nor women's, we hasten to add). Little plans also do not have the power to provide a better education to 56 million kids who deserve more than they are getting today. We face a crushing need in schools, have a solid plan to address it, and with your help, we intend to grow this very large and very fast. Where are you located? We are in Manhattan, conveniently located right across from Madison Square Garden. We will also hire interns to work remotely from other cities. What skills and experience are you looking for? We seek a wide range of skills: graphic designers, videographers, writers, researchers, creative thinkers, analytical sorts, community organizers, social media stars, people with great communication skills, MBA students, and more. I looked at your site and have some suggestions. Great! This is a collaborative project, and we want to hear from everyone. Is this a paid internship? We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your resum\u00e9, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions. When will you select the interns? We're agile. When we see a great candidate, we extend an invitation immediately. We won't keep you waiting for a decision. What dates will the internship run? We are hiring for the summer, for the fall semester, and beyond. Tell us what you are looking for. What are the hours? We welcome full-time and part-time interns. Let us know what works for you. What will I need to bring? Brains, heart, passion, energy, a notebook computer, and a passion to make an immediate improvement to the education of tens of millions of children. Sounds exciting! How can I apply? Please send an impressive cover letter and a resume to interns@ClassWish.org.", "title": "Help Children Get A Better Education: Intern at Classwish!

RSVP for our Information Session for Video Professionals! (See RSVP details below!) Our goal is to put together a volunteer team that can edit the groundbreaking work being done at The Actors Theatre Workshop. Using your professional skills to edit this wonderful material will surely stimulate hope, excitement and I believe bring true enlightenment to those who participate. At the same time you will reach another dimension in your craft as you learn about the unique filming/editing perspective of the ATW Founder and Artistic Director, Thurman E. Scott. ATW has long been on the front lines of disciplined creative training for theater professionals and individuals committed to fulfilling their creative potential. ATW has also been a safe haven for thousands of at-risk and homeless youth. The original theater and educational technique which has been tremendously successful with our professional acting students, has proven to be equally beneficial to the children we teach in our after-school programs. We have many years of footage from our adult acting workshop's and community program's that we want to share with you and the world. We've started sharing this video online and we've received such positive feedback from every corner of the globe that we are taking steps to put out more. This process takes time and so we would like to find more dedicated individuals who want to learn and make a difference in other people's lives and be a part of something hopeful by joining our video editing team. Our editors often talk about the beautiful, inspiring and deeply moving moments they have witnessed when a student actor or a child from a homeless shelter brings forth his talent and reaches for their potential. You literally see the moments when there is a shift in consciousness and they begin to accept their strength and the unique gifts that they have to offer the world. And in that moment you know that this person has changed forever-- and as a result undoubtedly so have you. By working directly with this material you will gain deep insight into the emotional and psychological breakdown of drama, and learn to see the penetrating insights that come out of script analysis, which gives you the ability to find and understand the eternal essence of ideas that are then formulated into a universal idea that helps to instill faith and spread hope to all individuals on a creative journey. So without further ado.. We invite you to a Volunteer Info Session for video editing professionals .To RSVP go to: http://www.actorstheatreworkshop.com, click on \\\"volunteers\\\" and fill out an online application.

This is an intensive Leadership Training Program in non-profit business management. Interns receive hands-on training as a management assistant. If skilled in video, interns may assist in video production and editing at our award-winning theater arts and community service organization. As video production becomes increasingly critical to the growth, development and success of managing a successful non-profit, we seek intern candidates that are leaders who are passionate about non-profit management and posses skills in video production and editing. Successful non-profits are built on powerful ideas that inspire hope. These ideas are manifested in the programs and the management of the organization. By gaining a working understanding of how to successfully manage a nonprofit organization, the intern begins to learn its core principals, which allows the intern to begin to take a leadership role in the organization. In addition, this knowledge is invaluable in the creation of videos that effectively promote and bring this work to the world. These videos are essential to the marketing and fund-raising efforts in any successful non-profit. We are looking for individuals with the ability to lead, manage teams, work independently, communicate effectively on the phone, in person and in writing and interact in a fast-paced business environment. We are looking for idealists and leaders who can put their thoughts and insights into action; positive, enthusiastic individuals who want to make a difference in the world and are committed to upholding the legacy and tradition of theater in the belief that theater can change a life and make the world a better place for everyone. The interns' primary responsibility is to manage the daily administrative operations of the organization and to take a leadership role in programming initiatives. There will be opportunities to work closely with the senior staff: in administrating over workshops for actors and community programs that serve Youth-at-Risk and homeless children. Under ATW supervision, interns will be accountable for projects in the management of ATW's studio rental business, administration, team management, marketing, development, sales, fund-raising, video production, event planning, and graphic design.

In addition, Interns may also work on a combination of logging, editing, and production of on-going video projects that depend on ATW's current schedule and on the intern's skill level. Interns will work under the direction of a project manager. We seek applicants with training and experience logging footage, editing in Final Cut Pro, http streaming, digital shooting, lighting, sound and web design and development. Interns and Volunteers consistently report they gain tremendously from filming and reviewing footage of ATW classes and workshops and have benefited as if they had actually taken the classes themselves. In summary, we seek professional, detail-oriented individuals who are positive and curious, with a desire to learn and engage in a process.

BRC gives our clients the knowledge and skills to stay sober and healthy and the sense of responsibility and value to find and maintain a home--in other words, the means to achieve permanent independence. BRC helps these neediest New Yorkers overcome the challenges of addiction, physical and mental illness, and poverty, and improves life in the community. Outreach is BRC's program for homeless individuals living on the streets and in other unstable situations. It is the most extensive outreach program in New York City covering specific Manhattan based locations, i.e. Grand Central Station, Penn Station and Port Authority Bus Terminal, 5 days per week in vans and on foot. Outreach staff and volunteers engages homeless individuals with the goal of assessing each individual's situation and needs and providing each client with an accessible doorway to services they need. Clients are afforded referral, transportation and placement at the resource deemed most beneficial to the individual, and each is treated with respect, professionalism and informed guidance. The Outreach Team encounters many individuals that are reluctant to use services or have found the available resources unmanageable and overwhelming. These clients are provided with counseling, information and advocacy in pursuing services, rights and resources. Every individual engaged is given the opportunity to access the services most suited to their needs. Working with Outreach staff, volunteers will help refer clients to assessment shelters, drop-in centers, drug and alcohol treatment, psychiatric and medical facilities, job training centers and entitlement offices. Normally a staff-only position, volunteers are needed to help us continue in our Outreach efforts. All teams will be midtown Manhattan based specifically at the Port Authority Bus Terminal on either Wednesday of Thursday evenings from 7pm to 9:30pm. This is the perfect opportunity for friends or co-workers who want to get involved together because teams will be comprised of a minimum of three individuals per shift, with a maximum of four each.

Grace Healthcare Services is a Community-based Hospice program that cares for Veterans at the end of life. Volunteers are an essential component of this care.

As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee.

They are in essence, the voice of the child, in court. CASA Volunteers interview parents, doctors, educators, foster parents, therapists, and anyone else involved in the life of the child they are assigned. Their goal is to provide child-focused reports to the court, which will lead to a speedy, safe, and permanent placement for the child. This is why it is imperative for these volunteers to go through extensive training. All Volunteers are screened closely for objectivity, competence, and commitment. You can become a CASA volunteer if: You have never been convicted of a crime and can pass a criminal background check. You are not personally involved with DCP&P (the state child welfare agency). Your job (and your life) is flexible. You are at least 21 years old. You are willing to make a one-year commitment. You pass CASA&rsquo;s screening process. Typically, a CASA volunteer will spend an average 10-20 hours per month working with their assigned case. Each case is different, so the amount of time required to get the job done varies significantly. We do require the volunteer to visit the child once every two weeks and be in court once every three months. CASA for Children of Bergen County asks that you make a one-year commitment. We prefer that a volunteer continue with their assigned case until it is permanently resolved which typically involves an 18 months - two year commitment. One of the primary benefits of the CASA program is that, unlike many caseworkers, most CASA volunteers remain a consistent figure during the course of case proceedings. This provides important continuity for children. Potential CASA volunteers must attend an Information Session, be interviewed and be accepted into training. CASA provides extensive training for our volunteers so that they are prepared to provide children with the support they desperately need. CASA volunteers undergo a thorough 36-hour training course. They learn about courtroom procedure, effective advocacy techniques for children, and specific topics ranging from child abuse to early childhood development and adolescent behavior. In addtion, trainees must attend 3 hours of court observation before being sworn-in by the presiding Family Court judge. Volunteers are required to attend 12 hours of continued training for each year of service. Our training course is offered several times a year and will prepare you for your volunteer experience.

The Way To Happiness is a non-denominational movement reversing the decline and restoring to man, his integrity and trust. Comprised of 21 principles, The Way To Happiness is a moral code based wholly on common sense. More than 70 million copies of The Way To Happiness booklet have been distributed in over 130 countries. Because it is non-religious in nature it can be used as a tool to re-introduce moral values into the Court system, without violating the codes and laws which separate Church and State. The Way To Happiness booklet educates readers worldwide with a non-religious code which guides one to a better quality of life, restoring and nourishing those qualities such as tolerance, respect and forgiveness, which have been revered through the centuries. These principles can be followed by anyone of any race color or creed. The Way To Happiness principles have been successfully used to help improve family relations, increase tolerance in the workplace and even in the prison system which has noted a remarkable drop in the recidivism of offenders who have completed the program. The principles work to restore the bonds that unite mankind. For more information you may visit the foundation's website www.thewaytohappiness.org.

Description The Way To Happiness: Because your survival is important to me. Happiness: N. A condition or state of well being, contentment, pleasure, joyful, untroubled existence, the reaction to having nice things happen to one. If one does not survive, no joy and no happiness are obtainable. Trying to survive in a chaotic (1) ,dishonest and generally immoral (2) society is difficult. Any individual seeks to obtain from life what pleasure and freedom from pain that they can. Your own survival can be threatened by the bad actions of others around you. Your own happiness can be turned to tragedy and sorrow by the dishonesty and misconduct of others. I am sure you can think of this actually happening. Such wrongs reduce one's survival and impair one's happiness. You are important to other people. You are listened to. You can influence others. The happiness or unhappiness of others you could name is important to you. Without too much trouble, using this book, you can help them survive and lead happier lives. While no one can guarantee that anyone else can be happy, their chances of survival and happiness can be improved. And with theirs, yours will be. It is in your power to point the way to a less dangerous and happier life. (1) Chaotic: having the character or nature of total disorder or confusion. (2) Immoral: Not moral; not following good practices of behavior; not doing right; lacking any idea of proper conduct. 1.

BE WORTHY OF TRUST. 14-1 keep your word once given. 15. FUFILL YOUR OBLIGATIONS. 16. BE INDUSTRIOUS.

As an embedded tutor, you will collaborate with an instructor to improve students&rsquo; performance, while being supported and guided by an experienced academic support professional. All embedded tutors commit three hours for the week. You will sit in on the class, and sometimes provide tutoring support after class (or on a different day if that's more agreeable) depending on students&rsquo; availability and interest. You will speak with the instructor weekly to prep for the next class and debrief after the Wed session. You would identify and support students who are struggling and provide feedback to the instructor regarding students' concerns and difficulties that can lead to changes in future lessons. You might also design assignments, identify/track students who are struggling and create differentiated instruction as the need arises. CT's embedded tutoring program has been successful in helping students gain access to support that they otherwise would not have received. Your work with us would help the students&rsquo; overall subject area performance, and help us improve this educational support model at the site. To apply, you must: Have received an A- or A in the introduction to the subject course you are applying to tutor. Have a GPA at or above 3.2, or have received a degree recently. Be willing to complete 11.5 hours of College Reading and Learning Aligned (CRLA) training at City College of New York.

At Literacy Volunteers of America, Essex & Passaic Counties, we help adults achieve all of those things. But we need your help: We need more volunteers to teach Basic Literacy and English for Speakers of Other Languages. No teaching experience or knowledge of a second language is required, just a desire to help. We are plumbers and secretaries, job seekers, administrators, retired teachers, journalists, even a former Peace Corps member or two. Our students are from the United States and more than 150 other countries - from Albania to Zimbabwe. Many are waiting for help. A great way to help is to join our tutor training workshop in Clifton, which meets on five Saturday afternoons at the Clifton Public Library, 1:00-4:15 pm, June 17, 24, July 1, 8, and 15, 2017. Attendance at all sessions is highly recommended. It&rsquo;s not too late to help improve the life of an adult and his or her family.

Yet many adults find themselves in exactly that position, particularly here in Essex County, where one in every four adults is considered functionally illiterate in English, according to U.S. Department of Education data. When you help an adult, you help her or his entire family. At Literacy Volunteers of America, Essex & Passaic Counties, we have a long list of U.S. citizens and immigrants, among them refugees and asylum seekers, waiting for help in learning to speak, understand, read, and write in English. But we need volunteers to teach them. Here's how you can help: Become a volunteer literacy tutor by attending our tutor training course at the Clifton Public Library, 292 Piaget Avenue, Conference Room A, Clifton, NJ 07011, Saturdays, 1:00-4:15 pm, June 17, 24, July 1, 8, and 15, 2017.

CASA was created to make sure the abuse and neglect these children originally suffered in the home doesn't continue as abuse and neglect at the hands of the system. As trained advocates, CASA volunteers get to know children in foster care and talk with their caregivers, schools, therapists, and other professionals, in order to gather information about their wellbeing and advocate for them in court. CASA volunteers advocate for the appropriate services to be offered to the children and their families and assist the Court in determining the appropriate permanent plan for each child.
