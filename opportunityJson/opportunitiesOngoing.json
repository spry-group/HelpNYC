The SoulGentz is being created as the \\\"brother\\\" organization to the SoulDeevas - and you may learn more about them at www.souldeevas.com. The Gentz will open by featuring a basketball and step team for boys ages 13 to 18. Our new season is expected to begin in September, but depending on what is happening with schools in light of the pandemic, we may be virtual to start. When we return to in-person practices we anticipate holding practice on Saturdays from 4:00pm to 6:00pm at the Rahway YMCA in Downtown Rahway, NJ (Irving St/Central Avenue). In our virtual state, we will work with the fitness coaches to develop an online schedule for the boys which we hope to continue throughout the season. We hope to recruit two coaches per team to cover one another in the event of absence. Each team will have a roster of about fifteen boys and we generally find that they are beginners - with about 10% of each team's members having some form of basketball experience. The teams will be trained to compete on local and national fields. Because the pandemic leaves us \\\"up in the air\\\" around in-person practices, we wanted to create a fitness program that would engage the boys while they are at home. Of course, as the weather starts getting colder, they will have limited opportunity to be outside, so our thought was to create a fitness and instructional program that would prepare them for eventual practices. The fitness coach would be asked to videotape themselves doing stretches and other \\\"indoor friendly\\\" warm-up exercises for the boys and we would challenge them to do these on their own time to develop strength and flexibility. The trainer would also have the boys log on once a week to discuss basketball terminology (including rules) for the benefit of boys who may have natural skill but no experience with the sport. To keep them engaged, the coach can also develop other online team building activities to help the boys get to know each other and can also challenge them to research basketball history or discuss what is currently happening within the NBA. The possibilities are unlimited for someone who is very creative and able to connect with teen boys. This is not a basketball coaching position; however, if the candidate has such a desire/skill - we would welcome them to serve on the coaching staff. Once we do return to in person practices, the fitness trainer would be asked to attend practices to lead the boys in stretches/warm-ups and drills and would absolutely be welcomed to accompany the boys to games. Our primary ask is that you be consistent. Interested candidates should respond letting us know about their basketball and fitness experience and any burning questions that they have.

Sprout is a non-profit organization based in New York City focused on providing innovative programs for adults with developmental disabilities.With our network of resources and dedicated volunteers, which we call leaders, Sprout opens up fascinating new worlds to people with disabilities. Sprout's Overnight Vacations Program is looking for individuals who have the energy, motivation and desire to work with adults with developmental disabilities. What do Sprout leaders do? Sprout leaders' primary goal is to give adults with developmental disabilities the opportunity to experience and enjoy recreational, educational and leisure activities through overnight vacations. Leaders are responsible for the overall safety and enjoyment of their group, 24 hours a day, while on a Sprout trip. Duties include safety monitoring, personal hygiene assistance, providing physical and emotional support, activity planning, budgeting, logistics, and enhancing fun. The work is hard yet immensely rewarding as you develop leadership skills and gain insight into your own abilities. What type of training is provided? Leaders must complete a pre-service training, which provides the necessary procedures and tools to run a successful and enjoyable vacation. Leaders who are drivers receive extra training on how to safely drive our 15-passenger vans. In addition, all leaders receive a copy of Sprout's Leadership Handbook to help with policies and guidelines. What is the time commitment? Sprout vacations last 3 - 7 days depending on the time of year and destination of the trip. When a leader is selected for an overnight vacation, Sprout asks that the leader dedicate themselves to stay with their group throughout the entire duration of the vacation. Some leaders only choose to lead one trip a year while others spend several months with us leading up to 8 trips or more. Sprout strives to make our program flexible for our leaders based on the amount of time leaders can give. Do leaders have any free or personal time while on a trip? Sprout trips are working vacations for the leaders who choose to participate. Because Sprout leaders are responsible for their group 24 hours a day, there is no free or personal time allotted. In order to give our participants the opportunity to experience and enjoy a vacation, Sprout leaders must be available at all times to provide the support any one participant may need. What type of trips can Sprout leaders expect to join? A majority of Sprout trips take place within a day's drive of New York City. Destinations include Atlantic City, Amish Country, Boston, Lake George, Cleveland, Maine and Virginia Beach. Exotic trips like cruises, Hawaii, and Europe are presented to leaders who have demonstrated high levels of commitment, service hours and have gained positive feedback from participants and Sprout office staff. Are there any special skills or requirements? No special background or education is required to become a Sprout leader.

Here is an opportunity to help underprivileged children, to help under-served children, to help ALL children displaced from school by COVID-19, to help close the opportunity gap in America, by closing the education gap, by closing the literacy gap that looms large, like an impassable crevasse, separating the haves from the have-nots, the rich, the almost rich, the upper middle class, even the middle class, from the more than 100 million lower class, lower middle class, working class poor, impoverished and underprivileged Americans. We are looking for a few very special people, with fundraising, particularly, crowdsourcing expertise, either in the corporate or non-profit arena, who have the skills, expertise, experience, passion, and time to be part of something amazing that is about to fundamentally change the lives of millions of children. Right now, millions of children have no hope; but soon, they will have the opportunity to learn how to read, which, in turn, will open a window to education and to a world of potential for them that, not only, has never been opened before, but that has never even been seriously contemplated as a viable, potential reality. What we are talking about is an adaptive learning, gamified smartphone app, called FUNetix (www.FUNetix.org), that can teach children how to read, in their own home, in an average of just 12 hours of total instruction time! We are the American Youth Literacy Foundation, and we have been teaching children how to read for 12 years using a patented \\\"reading decoding system!\\\" We have been developing this app for about two years (but started concepting and working on prototypes almost five years ago); and this year we will launch this incredible smartphone app in the App Store and on Google Play at or around Thanksgiving, 2020, to help save millions of children from a lifetime of illiteracy! Already, there are millions of children who are struggling to learn how to read. Already, there are millions more who have given up on reading and are destined to go through life either completely illiterate, or with only semi-literate skills at best. And now with the displacement of 55 million children from school, for an indeterminate amount of time, the loss of reading capacity of the next generation, and the \\\"seemingly incessant,\\\" \\\"widening of the gap,\\\" presents a new \\\"crisis moment\\\" in American education, and a very real threat to the future success (in school, and in life) of millions of young children. But we believe there IS a way to bridge that gap, to make this a \\\"watershed moment\\\" instead of a crisis moment, by stopping that gap from widening. Universal access to literacy through FUNetix will close the opportunity gap by closing the education gap by closing the literacy gap to near zero. What happens after that, can only be imagined: a virtuous cycle of communication and learning, perhaps, between teachers and students, in ALL of America&rsquo;s schools and classrooms. And what happens after that? An entire generation of nearly 100% literate young people of all races, religions, creeds, cultures and socioeconomic backgrounds will, quite inevitably, reform the social fabric of the American landscape for the good, and for the benefit of innumerable generations to come. According to the U.S. Government&rsquo;s \\\"Annual Report Card,\\\" more than 20 million children in grades 3-12, in America's public schools today, can't read at anything close to a proficient level! Translated into \\\"English,\\\" that means they are either completely illiterate (\\\"Below Basic:\\\" 24%), or functionally illiterate/ semi-literate (\\\"Basic:\\\" 43%). Fully more than half of all America&rsquo;s public-school-educated children have between zero and minimal literacy skills. This travesty exists in spite of the fact that, as a nation, we spend more than $11,000 per year, per student, to deliver a public school \\\"education.\\\" Just over 24% of all students drop out of public school, most of them in 9th grade. That's 1 million per year! Since the year 2000, America has \\\"graduated\\\" more than 20 million illiterate \\\"students\\\" into the U.S. economy, into our socio-economic and socio-political marketplace of ideas without hope, and without basic survival skills. Without literacy, and without education, these young people have practically zero chance at fulfilling their personal potential; and economic security is simply unattainable. That&rsquo;s all about to change! The American Youth Literacy Foundation, dba FUNetix, is a 12 year old, nationwide, charitable 501 (c) (3) non-profit. We started out as a tutoring program in the regional Philadelphia, Central New Jersey area and we still provide some one-on-one tutoring. But our focus has always been on finding a scalable solution to the literacy crisis in America. With the rise of the smartphone and the amazing penetration of this incredibly powerful, and ubiquitously critical tool (currently estimated at 80%), even into the most impoverished communities in America, we realized several years ago, that the answer to scalability we had been searching for, was going to be in the form of an app. So for the past several years we have been working to convert our amazing reading curriculum, that teaches children how to read in an average of just 12 hours, into an app that teaches children how to read in about the same time. And this is where you come in. The curriculum that our app is based on is a patented reading decoding system, and is so effective at teaching children how to read, that it usually only takes 4-6 hours for them to understand the basic reading-learning system, (which includes a FUN, but intensive introduction to all 44 sounds of the English language, and the basic concept of blending sound symbols into words), and another 4-6 hours for them to reach a 2nd grade reading level! On, or about, Thanksgiving, 2020, we will deliver this incredible reading app to the App Store and Google Play, and with it, an end-user experience (the UX) to millions of children in America's inner cities and rural counties, in the barrios and the suburbs, and on the American Indian reservations, and everywhere in-between, where illiteracy is endemic and education and opportunity are, tragically, not universally attainable. FUNetix will make a profound impact on millions of individual lives, while also profoundly effecting major social improvement on a massive scale, to bring about real, sustainable change in underprivileged and fully privileged communities and classrooms alike, wherever illiteracy and poor literacy looms. Literacy as a path to education and opportunity for millions of American children, and potentially billions of children worldwide, is imminently near. Through FUNetix, the American Youth Literacy Foundation is making English accessible to everyone! The curriculum consists of more than 2,000, individually narrated screens. We first teach children the 44 sounds of the English language. Then we teach them how to \\\"map,\\\" or, associate symbols to each of these sounds. We teach them how to blend those sound symbols and those sounds together to make words and sentences and, ultimately, stories. It usually takes them only 4 hours to learn how to read our super child-friendly, phonetic English code called 21E. Over the next 4 hours, children learn how to use those sound symbols as a \\\"diacritic\\\" pronunciation guide to help them decode ANY English word. We call this the FUNetix Magic Decoder, because it works like magic: the magic symbols above the words reveal the hidden sounds of EVERY English word! FUNetix, the team, is a mission-focused, distributed network of currently, 51 people (and still growing), each contributing between 5 and 65 hours of volunteer time per week. The FUNetix organization is organized into 12 teams including Project Management, Graphic Design, Curriculum Development, UX/Beta Testing, Engineering, Community Outreach and Distribution, Web Development, Funding, Marketing, Communications and Public Relations, and others. There's much more to tell. You can read more about our story, and about us, at www.FUNetix.org and www.YouthLit.org. We have much more to do to get ready for our Thanksgiving launch! As for our Crowdsourcing Experts, we are looking for three, very special people, who have everything we mentioned above: passion, expertise, time, etc., to join our team and help us launch the FUNetix Reading App this fall. The ideal candidate will have a broad, deep and sophisticated understanding of, and experience in, raising money through social media and crowdsourcing sites like Kickstarter and GoFundMe, among others. Ultimately, our mission is to get the app, and via the app, literacy, out to the children who need it most; and for that, we still require significant funding to finish the app and implement our initial marketing and distribution strategy. We believe that with the right messaging, we will find potentially tens of thousands of people willing to help with this incredible cause and this incredible effort, by contributing small amounts. Our current needs for finishing the app and executing our marketing and distribution strategy fall between $100K and $200k; so this is not an insignificant amount. But the goal is to utilize this second round of funding to allow us to develop additional revenue streams that will take us forward into the future and allow us to continue to bring the, absolutely FREE, FUNetix 12 Hour Reading App to millions of children both in the U.S., and around the world. in many ways, our Thanksgiving launch will be more of a beginning than an end. It will be the beginning of a tireless effort to deliver the solution to the streets and homes and schools of America where children are trying, but endlessly failing at learning how to read. If you wish to be considered for this opportunity, please send us a cover letter and resume to HR@YouthLit.org, and tell us about your crowdsourcing and fundraising experience. We are looking for intelligent, creative, enthusiastic, cheerful, optimistic individuals, who have the time, energy, expertise and desire to make a true difference and be part of something amazing! This is a complex undertaking and we are looking for highly proficient and organized professionals. Individuals interested in this position must have the experience and ability to work in a virtual environment using select networking, file sharing, and communications tools and platforms, and must have extensive knowledge and experience in crowdsourcing websites and campaigns. Thank you! We hope this opportunity finds you at the right place and the right time in your career to make a difference and an impact, to add value, in an amazing way, to help millions of children who are waiting for someone, or some thing, to lead them out of a life of impoverishment and into a future of unlimited possibility and potential.

Complementary Volunteers are certified/trained professionals who can provide complementary modalities of reflexology, music, imagery and touch therapies such as Reiki, massage, therapeutic touch and healing hands. Pet Therapy Volunteers provide certified/trained pets who visit with patients.

As their advocate, you will be the voice for the young person in court, making sure that the judge knows what is in the young person's best interests. As their mentor you will work with the young person to help them make the best decisions and plans for their futures. The result is that the young person is more likely to achieve positive outcomes after they leave foster care. CASA of Union County is currently recruiting for our Spring 2017 class of volunteers. These volunteers will receive intensive training to equip them with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate their way through the court and child welfare systems. They will learn how to advocate for the best interest of the young people they are working with and make sure that they receive the services and assistance necessary to lead successful adult lives. A CASA volunteer is paired with one child or sibling set and stays on the case until the young person leaves the system. Please note: No legal or social service experience is required, but you must be 21 years of age. The CASA training is approximately thirty hours, with an additional 8 hour training to work specifically with young people between the ages of 14 and 21. The volunteer is required to make an 18 month commitment. By law, volunteers must have a full criminal background check and fingerprint check, as well as a screening interview before beginning training. We are especially in need of bilingual - particularly Spanish-speaking - volunteers.

In becoming a CASA volunteer you will become the voice for a child in a court proceeding, which often overlooks the wants, needs and desires of the child. Every year more than half a million abused and neglected children are in need of safe, permanent, nurturing homes. Too many spend years moving from one temporary home to another. They are more likely than other children to face homelessness, unemployment, even prison as adults. That's why Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) for children are important. CASA was created to make sure the abuse and neglect these children originally suffered at home doesn't continue as abuse and neglect at the hands of the system. As trained advocates, CASA volunteers are appointed by judges to be a voice for these children in court. The result is that a child is placed into a safe, loving home where he/she can thrive.

One day, he will provide enhanced independence and mobility to a person with disabilities - whether they're blind or visually impaired, or have a disability other than blindness. But Bosley isn't growing up at the Guide Dog Foundation for the Blind. Each year, the Guide Dog Foundation breeds about 300 exceptional puppies, and it's vital that Bosley and other pups like him spend the first year of their lives with surrounded by the love and security of volunteer foster families called puppy walkers. Puppy walkers help Foundation puppies grow up to be confident dogs. What's involved in raising a Guide Dog Foundation puppy? Bosley went to live with his puppy walkers when he was about nine weeks old. He's learning basic obedience and social skills while being exposed to many different situations. People who raise Guide Dog Foundation puppies say it is the most rewarding thing they've ever done. Puppy raisers come from everywhere - stay-at-home moms or dads, teachers, college students, retirees, people with flexible work environments - and are crucial members of the Guide Dog Foundation family. By opening their hearts and homes to a puppy, a puppy raiser plays a crucial role in helping a person with disabilities live an independent life. Every puppy walker family works with a Guide Dog Foundation puppy adviser, who is available to answer questions and offer guidance and support. When he is about 14 months old, Bosley will return to the Guide Dog Foundation's Smithtown campus to begin his training as a guide or service dog. Puppy raisers will admit it's tough to say good-bye, but when they see the pup they raised take its place at the side of someone with disabilities, the ache they feel turns pride. There are puppies waiting now to join your loving home for a chance to start their careers.

If you're a functioning adult, you can do our level of math. For example, if you can calculate the tip on your dinner bill without a calculator, you're set. Can you convert a fraction to a decimal and think of a real life application of it? That's the kind of stuff that we do. If you're game, join us! Prior experience is not required! Common Denominator provides basic training, curriculum, and materials. We're looking for role models to middle-schoolers. We find that kind, patient, and enthusiastic volunteers match well with our student population. Come join our volunteer family!

During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network.

Is your child an emerging reader in 1st, 2nd or 3rd grade who is on the path to reading, but isn&rsquo;t quite there yet? Now you can do something incredible to help your child, to help your family, and to help potentially millions of children and millions of families across the country, by teaching your child how to read in 12 hours using the FUNetix Literacy App, and by providing us with critical \\\"user feedback\\\" as part of our Advanced Product Trials. Imagine that your child could be reading within 12 hours of starting the FUNetix app. They can finish the school year on a strong, positive note, and they can continue reading throughout the summer, getting ready for their next grade level! The American Youth Literacy Foundation is a nationwide 501 (c) (3), charitable non-profit, founded in 2008 and dedicated to bringing literacy to ALL children by the time they finish 3rd grade. For the past 12 years, we have worked with thousands of children of all abilities across the country, teaching them how to read. We&rsquo;ve been able to identify and resolve the root cause of the reading problem. And we&rsquo;ve unlocked the \\\"secret code\\\" that enables kids to learn how to read incredibly quickly, and with a deep understanding of fundamental reading principles. After tens of thousands of hours working with children from all socio-economic backgrounds (and all reading abilities) across the country, we have developed and patented a reading curriculum called FUNetix. For 12 years we have been using this patented curriculum to teach children how to read. And for the past 4 years we have been translating our instructional games and activities into an app. We began building our app long before the Coronavirus ever hit, and we will be teaching children long after the Coronavirus leaves; but for right now, we are doing our final preparations to bring the app to the App Store and Google Play by Thanksgiving, 2020. By participating in our advanced product trials, you will be able to access the app before anyone else. We are inviting up to 1,000 people to download and play the entire app and provide critical feedback to us so that we can make our final decisions on how to optimize the user experience (UX) ahead of our launch. By using the FUNetix app, your child will learn ALL 44 sounds of the English language . They will learn how to blend sounds and sound symbols together to form words, using a \\\"Secret Code\\\" called 21E(r). They will learn all of this in about 4 hours. Then they will begin reading English words using our patented system of diacritics, which are special, child friendly sound symbols that show your child how to pronounce ANY English word. It takes about another 4 hours to begin mastering this special pronunciation guide. Then your child will spend another 4 hours of the app practicing, by playing games and reading stories, and receiving additional instruction, in order to build their skills and their confidence. After about 12 hours of total instruction time, your child will gain access to an entire library of wonderful content, including books, games, puzzles, poems, stories and treasure hunts. As they work their way through the many varied reading options, they will always have a simple button to push when they want to see, for example, how a new word is pronounced. They simply push the FUNetix button within the game or story and the diacritics magically appear. We call this button, the \\\"Magic Decoder.\\\" But you can only use the \\\"Magic Decoder\\\" if you know the \\\"Secret Code.\\\" Children who know the Secret Code can push the Magic Decoder button whenever they want to unlock the pronunciation of ANY English word. That&rsquo;s FUNetix! Your child will come out of the app reading at about a 2nd grade level, and they will be ready to accelerate at lightning speed into all things written, including books, stories, and grade level course material. If your child is already in 3rd grade or higher, they will now have the fundamental reading skills they need to quickly catch up to their grade level course material. The app works because it teaches \\\"phonological (sound) awareness\\\" FIRST, allowing the developing brain to create a \\\"neural map\\\" of the 44 unique sounds of English via the use of child-friendly, pictograms, or, \\\"sound symbols.\\\" The app works because it first shows children that each sound can be represented as a symbol; and then it shows children that these sound symbols can be blended together to form the very same words that we use in our everyday conversations. Children begin to recognize that sound symbols are the pictorial representations of our spoken language, and the fundamental building blocks of written code. The app works because it introduces English much later in the reading process (4 hours later). English spelling patterns like \\\"ee\\\" and \\\"ea,\\\" etc. are equated to one of the 44 building blocks of sound that the student is now already familiar with. When the app introduces English, it does so by showing children ALL of the pieces of a given word and how the sound of each piece (\\\"phonics\\\") is easily revealed by the Magic Decoder (the diacritic symbols they already know, strategically positioned above the word.) The app works because it teaches ALL of the fundamentals of reading in the RIGHT order. And the app works because it provides children with a \\\"touch of the button\\\" pronunciation guide, and teaches them how to interpret that pronunciation guide. It&rsquo;s like a set of training wheels. Children learn using the diacritics, but once they have seen a word a few times, they no longer need them. By the end of the app, children are essentially weaned off of the diacritics except where new, \\\"novel\\\" words are introduced, words that they have never seen before. For new words, students always have the FUNetix button available so they never have to ask a parent or teacher or older sibling how to decode it. They can do it themselves! And if it&rsquo;s a word they already know the meaning of, they immediately make the association and UNDERSTAND the context in which it is being used. So if you have 12 hours that you would like to donate to this cause, we are looking for up to 1,000 early users. We hope that you and your child have an incredible experience learning how to read with the patented \\\"FUNetix 12 Hour Literacy App!\\\" And we hope that your child becomes a lifelong reader like so many other children who have learned how to read using the FUNetix curriculum. And we hope that your candid feedback will help us make this app as fun and interesting and enjoyable as possible for millions of children who will use it after Thanksgiving, 2020. And of course this is all FREE. We are a 501 (c) (3) charitable non-profit, and we are giving this app away to the world, for FREE! That&rsquo;s our purpose and our mission! To sign up, simply go to www.FUNetix.org .

Grace Healthcare Services is a Hospice organization that cares for patients throughout NJ. Veterans at the end of life. Volunteers are an essential component of this care. WHY A NEED FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS? -Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect to patients who have served our country. -Veterans share a common bond and code of conduct. -The camaraderie that exists between Veterans has proven to be a great support for the Veterans we care for. As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee. Please help us honor our Veterans by giving them the gift of your time.

Volunteer Opportunities: Companionship Volunteers work directly with patients providing companionship, offering friendly visits, reading to patients, writing letters, offering a gentle touch or sharing a quiet moment. Complementary Volunteers are certified/trained professionals who can provide complementary modalities of reflexology, music, imagery and touch therapies such as Reiki, massage, therapeutic touch and healing hands. Pet Therapy Volunteers provide certified/trained pets who visit with patients. These animals provide loving memories for some and give unconditional love helping our patients feel connected to a larger world. Administrative Volunteers provide help to the staff in our Edison office by assisting with typing, addressing cards, organizing newsletters, creating packets, collating manuals and other varied clerical duties Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, huggable dolls/bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Junior Volunteers consist of groups such as girl/boy scouts or young people who wish to honor our patients by making holiday cards, posters, wall hangings and memory books. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families and friends of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network.

Here is an opportunity to help underprivileged children, to help under-served children, to help ALL children displaced from school by COVID-19, to help close the opportunity gap in America, by closing the education gap, by closing the literacy gap that looms large, like an impassable crevasse, separating the haves from the have-nots, the rich, the almost rich, the upper-middle class, even the middle class, from the more than 100 million lower class, lower middle class, working-class poor, impoverished and underprivileged Americans. We are looking for ONE, a very special person, who has the skills, expertise, experience, passion, and time to be part of something amazing that is about to fundamentally change the lives of millions of children. Right now, millions of children have no hope; but soon, they will have the opportunity to learn how to read, which, in turn, will open a window to education and to a world of potential for them that, not only, has never been opened before, but that has never even been seriously contemplated as a potential reality. What we are talking about is an adaptive learning, gamified smartphone app, called FUNetix (www.FUNetix.org), that can teach children how to read, in their own home, in an average of just 12 hours of total instruction time! We are the American Youth Literacy Foundation, and we have been teaching children how to read for 12 years using a patented \\\"reading decoding system!\\\" We have been developing this app for about two years (but started the concept and working on prototypes almost five years ago); and this year we will launch this incredible smartphone app in the App Store and on Google Play at or around Thanksgiving, 2020, to help save millions of children from a lifetime of illiteracy! Already, there are millions of children who are struggling to learn how to read. Already, there are millions more who have given up on reading and are destined to go through life either completely illiterate or with only semi-literate skills at best. And now with the displacement of 55 million children from school, for an indeterminate amount of time, the loss of reading capacity of the next generation, and the \\\"seemingly incessant,\\\" \\\"widening of the gap,\\\" presents a new \\\"crisis moment\\\" in American education and a very real threat to the future success (in school, and in life) of millions of young children. But we believe there IS a way to bridge that gap, to make this a \\\"watershed moment\\\" instead of a crisis moment, by stopping that gap from widening. Universal access to literacy through FUNetix will close the opportunity gap by closing the education gap by closing the literacy gap to near zero. What happens after that, can only be imagined: a virtuous cycle of communication and learning, perhaps, between teachers and students, in ALL of America&rsquo;s schools and classrooms. And what happens after that? An entire generation of nearly 100% literate young people of all races, religions, creeds, cultures and socioeconomic backgrounds will, quite inevitably, reform the social fabric of the American landscape for the good, and for the benefit of innumerable generations to come. According to the U.S. Government&rsquo;s \\\"Annual Report Card,\\\" more than 20 million children in grades 3-12, in America's public schools today, can't read at anything close to a proficient level! Translated into \\\"English,\\\" that means they are either completely illiterate (\\\"Below Basic:\\\" 24%), or functionally illiterate/ semi-literate (\\\"Basic:\\\" 43%). Fully more than half of all America&rsquo;s public-school-educated children have between zero and minimal literacy skills. This travesty exists in spite of the fact that, as a nation, we spend more than $11,000 per year, per student, to deliver a public school \\\"education.\\\" Just over 24% of all students drop out of public school, most of them in 9th grade. That's 1 million per year! With the rise of the smartphone and the amazing penetration of this powerful tool, even into the most impoverished communities, we feel that the answer we have been searching for IS in the form of an app. So for the past several years, we have been working to convert our amazing reading curriculum, which teaches children how to read in just 12 hours, into an app that teaches children how to read in about the same time. And this is where you come in. Since the year 2000, America has \\\"graduated\\\" more than 20 million illiterate \\\"students\\\" into the U.S. economy, into our socio-economic and socio-political marketplace of ideas without hope, and without basic survival skills. Without literacy, and without education, these young people have practically zero chance at fulfilling their personal potential; and economic security is simply unattainable. That&rsquo;s all about to change! The American Youth Literacy Foundation, dba FUNetix, is a 12-year-old, nationwide, charitable 501 (c) (3) non-profit. We started out as a tutoring program in the regional Philadelphia, Central New Jersey area and we still provide some one-on-one tutoring. But our focus has always been on finding a scalable solution to the literacy crisis in America. With the rise of the smartphone and the amazing penetration of this incredibly powerful, and ubiquitously critical tool (currently estimated at 80%), even into the most impoverished communities in America, we realized several years ago, that the answer to scalability we had been searching for, was going to be in the form of an app. So for the past several years, we have been working to convert our amazing reading curriculum, which teaches children how to read in an average of just 12 hours, into an app that teaches children how to read in about the same time. And this is where you come in. The curriculum that our app is based on is a patented reading decoding system, and is so effective at teaching children how to read, that it usually only takes 4-6 hours for them to understand the basic reading-learning system, (which includes a FUN, but intensive introduction to all 44 sounds of the English language, and the basic concept of blending sound symbols into words), and another 4-6 hours for them to reach a 2nd-grade reading level! On, or about, Thanksgiving, 2020, we will deliver this incredible reading app to the App Store and Google Play, and with it, an end-user experience (the UX) to millions of children in America's inner cities and rural counties, in the barrios and the suburbs, and on the American Indian reservations, and everywhere in-between, where illiteracy is endemic and education and opportunity are, tragically, not universally attainable. FUNetix will make a profound impact on millions of individual lives, while also profoundly effecting major social improvement on a massive scale, to bring about real, sustainable change in underprivileged and fully privileged communities and classrooms alike, wherever illiteracy and poor literacy looms. Literacy as a path to education and opportunity for millions of American children, and potentially billions of children worldwide, is imminently near. Through FUNetix, the American Youth Literacy Foundation is making English accessible to everyone! The curriculum consists of more than 2,000, individually narrated screens. We first teach children the 44 sounds of the English language. Then we teach them how to \\\"map,\\\" or, associate symbols to each of these sounds. We teach them how to blend those sound symbols and those sounds together to make words and sentences and, ultimately, stories. It usually takes them only 4 hours to learn how to read our super child-friendly, phonetic English code called 21E. Over the next 4 hours, children learn how to use those sound symbols as a \\\"diacritic\\\" pronunciation guide to help them decode ANY English words. We call this the FUNetix Magic Decoder because it works like magic: the magic symbols above the words reveal the hidden sounds of EVERY English word! FUNetix, the team, is a mission-focused, distributed network of currently, 51 people (and still growing), each contributing between 5 and 65 hours of volunteer time per week. The FUNetix organization is organized into 12 teams including Project Management, Graphic Design, Curriculum Development, UX/Beta Testing, Engineering, Community Outreach and Distribution, Web Development, Funding, Marketing, Communications, and Public Relations, and others. There's much more to tell. You can read more about our story, and about us, at www.FUNetix.org and www.YouthLit.org. We have much more to do to get ready for our Thanksgiving launch! Right now, we are looking for 1 very special person who has everything we mentioned above, passion, expertise, time, etc. to join our team and help us launch this app in 2020. Our lead project managers will help build the fundamental infrastructure upon which the \\\"product launch,\\\" as well as all members of our organization involved in the product launch, will depend, for effective, collaborative communication and productivity. The Lead Project Management Team will hire future project managers for specific tasking. If you are interested in becoming a \\\"task-specific\\\" project manager, please also contact us and we will file your resume appropriately for a later date. If you wish to be considered for this opportunity to be one of the three members of our Lead Project Management Team, please send us a cover letter and resume to hr@YouthLit.org. We are looking for intelligent, creative, enthusiastic, cheerful, optimistic individuals with significant project management experience and with experience using project management software.

We hope this opportunity finds you at the right place and the right time in your career to make a difference and an impact, in an amazing way, for millions of children who are waiting for someone, or something, to lead them out of a life of impoverishment and into a future of unlimited possibility and potential.

Is your child an emerging reader in 1st, 2nd or 3rd grade who is on the path to reading, but isn&rsquo;t quite there yet? Now you can do something incredible to help your child, to help your family, and to help potentially millions of children and millions of families across the country, by teaching your child how to read in 12 hours using the FUNetix Literacy App, and by providing us with critical \\\"user feedback\\\" as part of our Advanced Product Trials. Imagine that your child could be reading within 12 hours of starting the FUNetix app. They can finish the school year on a strong, positive note, and they can continue reading throughout the summer, getting ready for their next grade level! The American Youth Literacy Foundation is a nationwide 501 (c) (3), charitable non-profit, founded in 2008 and dedicated to bringing literacy to ALL children by the time they finish 3rd grade. For the past 12 years, we have worked with thousands of children of all abilities across the country, teaching them how to read. We&rsquo;ve been able to identify and resolve the root cause of the reading problem. And we&rsquo;ve unlocked the \\\"secret code\\\" that enables kids to learn how to read incredibly quickly, and with a deep understanding of fundamental reading principles. After tens of thousands of hours working with children from all socio-economic backgrounds (and all reading abilities) across the country, we have developed and patented a reading curriculum called FUNetix. For 12 years we have been using this patented curriculum to teach children how to read. And for the past 4 years we have been translating our instructional games and activities into an app. We began building our app long before the Coronavirus ever hit, and we will be teaching children long after the Coronavirus leaves; but for right now, we are doing our final preparations to bring the app to the App Store and Google Play by Thanksgiving, 2020. By participating in our advanced product trials, you will be able to access the app before anyone else. We are inviting up to 1,000 people to download and play the entire app and provide critical feedback to us so that we can make our final decisions on how to optimize the user experience (UX) ahead of our launch. By using the FUNetix app, your child will learn ALL 44 sounds of the English language . They will learn how to blend sounds and sound symbols together to form words, using a \\\"Secret Code\\\" called 21E(r). They will learn all of this in about 4 hours. Then they will begin reading English words using our patented system of diacritics, which are special, child friendly sound symbols that show your child how to pronounce ANY English word. It takes about another 4 hours to begin mastering this special pronunciation guide. Then your child will spend another 4 hours of the app practicing, by playing games and reading stories, and receiving additional instruction, in order to build their skills and their confidence. After about 12 hours of total instruction time, your child will gain access to an entire library of wonderful content, including books, games, puzzles, poems, stories and treasure hunts. As they work their way through the many varied reading options, they will always have a simple button to push when they want to see, for example, how a new word is pronounced. They simply push the FUNetix button within the game or story and the diacritics magically appear. We call this button, the \\\"Magic Decoder.\\\" But you can only use the \\\"Magic Decoder\\\" if you know the \\\"Secret Code.\\\" Children who know the Secret Code can push the Magic Decoder button whenever they want to unlock the pronunciation of ANY English word. That&rsquo;s FUNetix! Your child will come out of the app reading at about a 2nd grade level, and they will be ready to accelerate at lightning speed into all things written, including books, stories, and grade level course material. If your child is already in 3rd grade or higher, they will now have the fundamental reading skills they need to quickly catch up to their grade level course material. The app works because it teaches \\\"phonological (sound) awareness\\\" FIRST, allowing the developing brain to create a \\\"neural map\\\" of the 44 unique sounds of English via the use of child-friendly, pictograms, or, \\\"sound symbols.\\\" The app works because it first shows children that each sound can be represented as a symbol; and then it shows children that these sound symbols can be blended together to form the very same words that we use in our everyday conversations. Children begin to recognize that sound symbols are the pictorial representations of our spoken language, and the fundamental building blocks of written code. The app works because it introduces English much later in the reading process (4 hours later). English spelling patterns like \\\"ee\\\" and \\\"ea,\\\" etc. are equated to one of the 44 building blocks of sound that the student is now already familiar with. When the app introduces English, it does so by showing children ALL of the pieces of a given word and how the sound of each piece (\\\"phonics\\\") is easily revealed by the Magic Decoder (the diacritic symbols they already know, strategically positioned above the word.) The app works because it teaches ALL of the fundamentals of reading in the RIGHT order. And the app works because it provides children with a \\\"touch of the button\\\" pronunciation guide, and teaches them how to interpret that pronunciation guide. It&rsquo;s like a set of training wheels. Children learn using the diacritics, but once they have seen a word a few times, they no longer need them. By the end of the app, children are essentially weaned off of the diacritics except where new, \\\"novel\\\" words are introduced, words that they have never seen before. For new words, students always have the FUNetix button available so they never have to ask a parent or teacher or older sibling how to decode it. They can do it themselves! And if it&rsquo;s a word they already know the meaning of, they immediately make the association and UNDERSTAND the context in which it is being used. So if you have 12 hours that you would like to donate to this cause, we are looking for up to 1,000 early users. We hope that you and your child have an incredible experience learning how to read with the patented \\\"FUNetix 12 Hour Literacy App!\\\" And we hope that your child becomes a lifelong reader like so many other children who have learned how to read using the FUNetix curriculum. And we hope that your candid feedback will help us make this app as fun and interesting and enjoyable as possible for millions of children who will use it after Thanksgiving, 2020. And of course this is all FREE. We are a 501 (c) (3) charitable non-profit, and we are giving this app away to the world, for FREE! That&rsquo;s our purpose and our mission!

Our nonprofit focuses on news about making the world a better place, particularly news related to topics such as global poverty, nonprofits, climate change and human rights. All volunteering is via the computer -- you can be anywhere in the world. The Daily Source is truly a 21st century journalism site. Our online software is incredibly easy to use and automates most of the layout process. Just drag and drop articles from one location to another and the page adjusts itself automatically. Editing the headlines is as easy as using Microsoft Word or sending an e-mail. You will receive guidance from our senior editors who are some of the top newspaper journalists in the U.S. Besides laying out the front page, you will find articles, videos, columns and other material from around the Internet for use on the site and make the final decision of what goes on the site. You will be doing real stuff that directly impacts our front page and our nonprofit's mission to help the world. You will also gain invaluable experience that will build your skills and look great on a resume. Some of our volunteers have gone on to work in the journalism field. Two of our volunteers started their own non-profit organization after eight months of volunteering with us. One of our editors was hired full-time by Wired.com and another was hired by Congress as the official congressional photographer of senators at public events. We have an extensive training process that is about a month long, so if we are going to train you, we need you to do a certain amount of hours in all to make it worth the time we put into it. Therefore, the Front Page Editor role is a minimum of 15 hours per week for a minimum of six months. If you can volunteer 20 hours or higher a week, then the minimum is only five months, or you can do 12 hours a week for seven and a half months. We tend to give preference to applicants who can do a sizable number of hours. All editors are credited at the bottom of the site each day, and daily editions are archived so your friends, family and future employers will see what you were part of creating. To view our front page, visit - http://dailysource.org/ To read more about us, view the links here - http://dailysource.org/about/site We usually also have the following openings (minimum hours per week and minimum number of months are in parenthesis). All these positions are telecommute so you don&rsquo;t have to drive or dress up, and can work from the comfort of your home. You might also be able to use our local Internet location, though there is some cost for that so virtual is preferred. If you apply for a position, you should view your commitment to it the same as if it were a paid position. We treat volunteers like normal staff and rely on them like staff. Our site is 99% volunteer run and we all depend on each other to make it a success. Please do not apply if you are viewing this opportunity as \\\"just a volunteer position\\\" and would treat it as less important than paid positions or other commitments you have. If you are in school, volunteering with us can function as an internship. Interns can usually receive credit with their school for their internships. Content Editor (10 hours a week for a minimum of 6 months): Searches the Internet for high quality articles, columns, editorials and videos, adds them to our system, and ranks them by quality. The front page editors pick from these to publish on the front page. Also does research and fact-checking when needed. This requires Internet surfing skills, strong understanding and judgment of the news, and attention to detail. Marketing and Social Media (6 hours a week for a minimum of 5 months): Help research potential media outlets and blogs to cover our site, e-mail our press releases to them, and keep track of coverage of our site that has occurred. We have a great website and need to get the word out about it. Help promote the website by updating our Facebook, Twitter and other social media pages, attracting new followers, and interacting with our existing followers. No marketing experience required, but you must be familiar with social media and be good at communicating. If you're interested in volunteering, please email us at volunteer@dailysource.org and let us know: * Which position or positions are you interested in? * How many hours per week and how many months can you do? We tend to give preference to people who can do more hours. * A description of your past work/volunteer experience and education, or a resume or a link to a LinkedIn profile. You can also apply directly through this website by clicking the button for that, and giving us the same information.

Volunteers and clients can join our site at https://tutoria.io. They select their interests (English tutoring, US Citizenship, or legal aid) and availability. They then connect with one another via direct message. The Ask: We are seeking a NYC-based videographer who will use pictures, video and written content to capture the experiences of our clients and volunteers. Through a keen eye for detail, the volunteer will design, compile and edit important moments and translate them into a compelling story for use online and in-person meetings. The videographer volunteer will work alongside other volunteer leaders (community managers and social media) who will provide contacts and images. Bilingual (English/Spanish) is preferred. Why Tutoria?: There is a strong demand from immigrants for education and legal services across the United States, and especially here in NYC.

Here is an opportunity to help underprivileged children, to help under-served children, to help ALL children displaced from school by COVID-19, to help close the opportunity gap in America, by closing the education gap, by closing the literacy gap that looms large, like an impassable crevasse, separating the haves from the have-nots, the rich, the almost rich, the upper middle class, even the middle class, from the more than 100 million lower class, lower middle class, working class poor, impoverished and underprivileged Americans. We are looking for a few very special people, with funding and business development experience, either in the corporate or non-profit arena, either as an entrepreneur or upper tier management, preferably in the technology sphere, who have the skills, expertise, experience, passion, and time to be part of something amazing that is about to fundamentally change the lives of millions of children. Right now, millions of children have no hope; but soon, they will have the opportunity to learn how to read, which, in turn, will open a window to education and to a world of potential for them that, not only, has never been opened before, but that has never even been seriously contemplated as a viable, potential reality. What we are talking about is an adaptive learning, gamified smartphone app, called FUNetix (www.FUNetix.org), that can teach children how to read, in their own home, in an average of just 12 hours of total instruction time! We are the American Youth Literacy Foundation, and we have been teaching children how to read for 12 years using a patented \\\"reading decoding system!\\\" We have been developing this app for about two years (but started concepting and working on prototypes almost five years ago); and this year we will launch this incredible smartphone app in the App Store and on Google Play at or around Thanksgiving, 2020, to help save millions of children from a lifetime of illiteracy! Already, there are millions of children who are struggling to learn how to read. Already, there are millions more who have given up on reading and are destined to go through life either completely illiterate, or with only semi-literate skills at best. And now with the displacement of 55 million children from school, for an indeterminate amount of time, the loss of reading capacity of the next generation, and the \\\"seemingly incessant,\\\" \\\"widening of the gap,\\\" presents a new \\\"crisis moment\\\" in American education, and a very real threat to the future success (in school, and in life) of millions of young children. But we believe there IS a way to bridge that gap, to make this a \\\"watershed moment\\\" instead of a crisis moment , by stopping that gap from widening. Universal access to literacy through FUNetix will close the opportunity gap by closing the education gap by closing the literacy gap to near zero. What happens after that, can only be imagined: a virtuous cycle of communication and learning, perhaps, between teachers and students, in ALL of America&rsquo;s schools and classrooms. And what happens after that? An entire generation of nearly 100% literate young people of all races, religions, creeds, cultures and socioeconomic backgrounds will, quite inevitably, reform the social fabric of the American landscape for the good, and for the benefit of innumerable generations to come. According to the U.S. Government&rsquo;s \\\"Annual Report Card,\\\" more than 20 million children in grades 3-12, in America's public schools today, can't read at anything close to a proficient level! Translated into \\\"English,\\\" that means they are either completely illiterate (\\\"Below Basic:\\\" 24%), or functionally illiterate/ semi-literate (\\\"Basic:\\\" 43%). Fully more than half of all America&rsquo;s public-school-educated children have between zero and minimal literacy skills. This travesty exists in spite of the fact that, as a nation, we spend more than $11,000 per year, per student, to deliver a public school \\\"education.\\\" Just over 24% of all students drop out of public school, most of them in 9th grade. That's 1 million per year! Since the year 2000, we have \\\"graduated\\\" more than 20 million illiterate \\\"students\\\" into the U.S. economy, into our socio-economic and socio-political marketplace of ideas without hope and without basic survival skills. Without literacy, and without education, these young people have no chance at fulfilling their personal potential; and economic security is simply unattainable. That&rsquo;s all about to change! We are partnered with an engineering team that was one of the five, $1 million finalists in the XPrize for Global Learning competition (the winners of which were announced in May, 2019) named Pubbly (www.Pubbly.com). The XPrize for Global Learning was a $15 million worldwide competition created to allow app \\\"design and development\\\" teams from around the world to build and deliver a tablet-based app to children in remote villages in Africa, that could teach them how to read and do basic math (children of all ages, most of whom had never been to school before in their lives). The XPrize was founded by Peter Diamandis and is credited with launching the commercial space industry, including SpaceX, with the original XPrize of $10 million, created to incent teams from around the world to build a rocket that could reach low earth orbit without help from NASA or any governmental space agency or nation state; and SpaceX's founder, Elon Musk is a key benefactor and contributor to XPrize, and a close personal friend of Peter Diamandis, who, in addition to being the founder of XPrize, is also the founder of Singularity University, among other entities. Pubbly competed in the 2015-2019 XPrize for Global Literacy; and the American Youth Literacy Foundation, ( www.YouthLit.org ) dba FUNetix, FUNetix.org and the FUNetix Reading App, competed in the 2015-2020 XPrize for Adult Literacy. FUNetix and Pubbly met through our mutual participation in XPrize; and XPrize specifically encourages open source, collaborative cooperation and sharing of assets among all of its competitors. The goal is to improve the world, solve global, intractable problems, and share information and ideas to make humanity and human lives better! As an offspring of two, separate XPrize competitions, FUNetix is a perfect example of collaborative partnering between teams of people originally brought together to begin exploring an advanced technological solution to global illiteracy and global educational challenges. The American Youth Literacy Foundation, dba FUNetix, is a 12 year old, nationwide, charitable 501 (c) (3) non-profit. We started out as a tutoring program in the regional Philadelphia, Central New Jersey area and we still provide some one-on-one tutoring. But our focus has always been on finding a scalable solution to the literacy crisis in America. With the rise of the smartphone and the amazing penetration of this incredibly powerful, and ubiquitously critical tool (currently estimated at 80%), even into the most impoverished communities in America, we realized several years ago, that the answer to scalability we had been searching for, was going to be in the form of an app. So for the past several years we have been working to convert our amazing reading curriculum, that teaches children how to read in an average of just 12 hours, into an app that teaches children how to read in about the same time. And this is where you come in. The curriculum that our app is based on is a patented reading decoding system, and is so effective at teaching children how to read, that it usually only takes 4-6 hours for them to understand the basic reading-learning system, (which includes a FUN, but intensive introduction to all 44 sounds of the English language, and the basic concept of blending sound symbols into words), and another 4-6 hours for them to reach a 2nd grade reading level! Compare this to so many of our students who, as discussed above, have been in the public school system for 6, 7, 8, 9 years or more, and are still unable to spell simple words like \\\"this, that, these, those and the.\\\" Compare this to millions of students who have dropped out of school, primarily because they can't read (more than 10 million per decade). Our organization is an \\\"all volunteer,\\\" mission-centric, extended virtual network, comprised of more than fifty, highly skilled and experienced individuals from around the country (and a few from around the world) who collaborate through cloud-based technology and platforms. The app consists of more than 2,000 screens, each individually narrated to most closely simulate a true one-on-one tutoring experience, which has been our hallmark for 12 years. Our five graphic designers, six curriculum content developers, six engineers and all of our support teams, including project management, curriculum management, and UX/Beta testing, along with our production and engineering partner, Pubbly, have built more than 1,200 screens since March; and we are slated to complete the 2,000+ buildout by mid August. On, or about, Thanksgiving, 2020, we will deliver this incredible reading app to the App Store and Google Play, and with it, an end-user experience (the UX) to millions of children in America's inner cities and rural counties, in the barrios and the suburbs, and on the American Indian reservations, and everywhere in-between, where illiteracy is endemic and education and opportunity are, tragically, not universally attainable. FUNetix is real, and tangible, and life changing; and unlike so many other discussions, conversations, policies, programs and protocols, AND, unlike so many other legacy (and even brand new) reading apps, reading programs and reading curricula based on legacy phonics pedagogy, (which doesn't scale, isn't amenable to self learning and doesn't teach children how to read in 120 hours, let along 12 hours), FUNetix will make a profound impact on millions of individual lives, while also profoundly effecting major social improvement on a massive scale, to bring about real, sustainable change in underprivileged and fully privileged communities and classrooms alike, wherever illiteracy and poor literacy looms. Literacy as a path to education and opportunity for millions of American children, and potentially billions of children worldwide, is imminently near. Through FUNetix, the American Youth Literacy Foundation is making English accessible to everyone! We have been preparing for this moment for 12 years, but as a matter of pure coincidence, our launch and final developmental timeline is coinciding with other powerful forces in the country and the world, such as COVID and social justice awareness and unrest. Our role in the Coronavirus recovery and this social justice enigma, is to lift up and bring real, lasting, permanent life improvement to the more than 12 million 1st, 2nd and 3rd grade emerging readers who got knocked down by the Corona virus and knocked out of school, as so much collateral damage, so that they can get back to learning and education, in a new way, with better results than ever before, as if nothing had ever happened to derail their futures. Our role in effecting major social improvement, including improvement in areas of education, opportunity and equality has been at the forefront of our mission and vision since our inception as a charitable foundation in 2008. The convergence of universal forces that is allowing the FUNetix Reading App to fall on such fertile soil is something that we cannot explain. But in order to deliver this incredible app to the children who need it most, we still need to complete three pieces of the equation: what we call \\\"The Horse,\\\" \\\"The Cart,\\\" and \\\"The Payload.\\\" The Horse is the curriculum; and we are more than halfway through the conversion process from our analog to a new, super fun, super interactive, digital curriculum for kids. The Cart is the distribution system, the \\\"how do we get it out into communities and to the children, once it's built?\\\" Despite what some may think, just because we put an app in the App Store, doesn't mean it will go viral. We need to market, publicize and reach out to communities to make them aware of your creation, even if it's FREE, like FUNetix! For that, we have built our in-house Community Outreach and Distribution Team; and they are, in turn, building a network of Community Outreach Liaisons nationwide, as well as reaching out to community leaders, social media influencers, thought leaders, religious leaders, political leaders, sports and entertainment influencers and others, in order to find the best and most efficient pathways to deliver the message to the parents that literacy is within reach, and to ensure that the FUNetix Reading App gets into the hands of the children who need it most. And the Payload is the UX itself (the \\\"user experience\\\"). But it's not just the child (the ultimate beneficiary) who must enjoy the experience enough to continue through the progressive learning modules, it's also the parent, or guardian, or friend, or grandparent, or sibling, or concerned adult, who must be supported. And for that we are building the support system and the support network that will scale with the app , and not constrain the growth and penetration of the app into the multifarious interstitial spaces of American society, wherever children are in need. We are creating that support network for caring adults, which will consist of in-app information as well as web-based content that they can refer to, in order to gain a better understanding of what the app is and how it works, and how they can best assist their child or grandchild through the learning process. In addition, all of our external communications will be supported and cross connected through our website and via a variety of social media outlets. Our brand, image, content and messaging has been, and will continue to be, a collaboration between our Graphic Design, UX, Marketing and Communications, Web Development, Curriculum Content, Funding and Community Outreach teams. As we mentioned, the curriculum consists of more than 2,000, individually narrated screens. We first teach children the 44 sounds of the English language. Then we teach them how to \\\"map,\\\" or, associate symbols to each of these sounds. We teach them how to blend those sound symbols and those sounds together to make words and sentences and, ultimately, stories. It usually takes them only 4 hours to learn how to read our super child-friendly, phonetic English code called 21E. Over the next 4 hours, children learn how to use those sound symbols as a \\\"diacritic\\\" pronunciation guide to help them decode ANY English word. We call this the FUNetix Magic Decoder, because it works like magic: the magic symbols above the words reveal the hidden sounds of EVERY English word! Like training wheels on a bike, children use the Magic Decoder to practice, practice, practice reading for the final four hours of the app, until the training wheels are ready to come off. Then they graduate, and are introduced into the Wonderful Content Library, where they can read all kinds of stories, books and poems, and play puzzles and games, and go on treasure hunts and virtual scavenger hunts using the newly developed reading skills that they now have. And on every screen in the Wonderful Content Library, kids have the FUNetix Magic Hat button with them, so that if they ever come across a word they've never seen before, or that they forgot how to decode, they can push the button and see the FUNetix Magic Code, and don&rsquo;t have to stop and ask a grown up or a sibling, and so that they can continue on, and keep up the momentum and the pace of reading, without getting distracted, or side tracked or frustrated, or, worse yet, give up! FUNetix, the team, is a mission-focused, distributed network of currently, 48 people (and still growing), each contributing between 5 and 65 hours of volunteer time per week. Our partnership with Pubbly is contractual, and we pay for engineering, coding, animation, narration and other services. The FUNetix organization is organized into 12 teams including Project Management, Graphic Design, Curriculum Development, UX/Beta Testing, Engineering, Community Outreach and Distribution, Web Development, Funding, Marketing, Communications and Public Relations, and others. There's much more to tell. You can read more about our story, and about us, at www.FUNetix.org and www.YouthLit.org. We have much more to do to get ready for our Thanksgiving launch! As for our Business Development/Funding Team Leads, we have 2 openings left (all of our teams have 3 team leads and sometimes, additional, task specific, team members). So, we are now looking for two, very special people, who have everything we mentioned above: passion, expertise, time, etc., to join our team and help us launch the FUNetix Reading App this fall. Our Funding Team Leads will help us explore, develop, plan and execute a broad set of funding initiatives to include: Grant Writing, Philanthropic Donations, Crowdsourcing, Sponsorships, Fundraising Events, Licensing and other forms of App Monetization. The ideal candidate will have a broad, deep and sophisticated understanding of sales, marketing, technology and funding, derived from multiple years of experience, either as an entrepreneur, corporate executive, or non-profit director or board member. The Team Lead may have grant writing or crowdsourcing experience, but these specialties will also be sourced, and additional team members will be hired to meet the needs of the organization in terms of fundraising for operational (engineering, coding, Pubbly) costs, as well as marketing, distribution, expansion and ongoing initiatives to deliver the app broadly and quickly into disparate communities across America. Ultimately, our mission is to get the app, and via the app, literacy, out to the children who need it most. Thanksgiving, in many ways, will be more of a beginning than an end. It will be the beginning of a tireless effort to deliver the solution to the streets and homes and schools of America where children are trying, but endlessly failing at learning how to read. If you wish to be considered for this opportunity, please send us a cover letter and resume to HR@YouthLit.org. We are looking for intelligent, creative, enthusiastic, cheerful, optimistic individuals, who have the time, energy, expertise and desire to make a true difference and be part of something amazing! This is a complex undertaking and we are looking for highly proficient and organized professionals. Individuals interested in this position must have the experience and ability to work in a virtual environment using select networking, file sharing, and communications tools and platforms. Thank you! We hope this opportunity finds you at the right place and the right time in your career to make a difference and an impact, to add value, in an amazing way, to help millions of children who are waiting for someone, or some thing, to lead them out of a life of impoverishment and into a future of unlimited possibility and potential.

Is your child an emerging reader in 1st, 2nd or 3rd grade who is on the path to reading, but isn&rsquo;t quite there yet? Now you can do something incredible to help your child, to help your family, and to help potentially millions of children and millions of families across the country, by teaching your child how to read in 12 hours using the FUNetix Literacy App, and by providing us with critical \\\"user feedback\\\" as part of our Advanced Product Trials. Imagine that your child could be reading within 12 hours of starting the FUNetix app. They can finish the school year on a strong, positive note, and they can continue reading throughout the summer, getting ready for their next grade level! The American Youth Literacy Foundation is a nationwide 501 (c) (3), charitable non-profit, founded in 2008 and dedicated to bringing literacy to ALL children by the time they finish 3rd grade. For the past 12 years, we have worked with thousands of children of all abilities across the country, teaching them how to read. We&rsquo;ve been able to identify and resolve the root cause of the reading problem. And we&rsquo;ve unlocked the \\\"secret code\\\" that enables kids to learn how to read incredibly quickly, and with a deep understanding of fundamental reading principles. After tens of thousands of hours working with children from all socio-economic backgrounds (and all reading abilities) across the country, we have developed and patented a reading curriculum called FUNetix. For 12 years we have been using this patented curriculum to teach children how to read. And for the past 4 years we have been translating our instructional games and activities into an app. We began building our app long before the Coronavirus ever hit, and we will be teaching children long after the Coronavirus leaves; but for right now, we are doing our final preparations to bring the app to the App Store and Google Play by Thanksgiving, 2020. By participating in our advanced product trials, you will be able to access the app before anyone else. We are inviting up to 1,000 people to download and play the entire app and provide critical feedback to us so that we can make our final decisions on how to optimize the user experience (UX) ahead of our launch. By using the FUNetix app, your child will learn ALL 44 sounds of the English language . They will learn how to blend sounds and sound symbols together to form words, using a \\\"Secret Code\\\" called 21E(r). They will learn all of this in about 4 hours. Then they will begin reading English words using our patented system of diacritics, which are special, child friendly sound symbols that show your child how to pronounce ANY English word. It takes about another 4 hours to begin mastering this special pronunciation guide. Then your child will spend another 4 hours of the app practicing, by playing games and reading stories, and receiving additional instruction, in order to build their skills and their confidence. After about 12 hours of total instruction time, your child will gain access to an entire library of wonderful content, including books, games, puzzles, poems, stories and treasure hunts. As they work their way through the many varied reading options, they will always have a simple button to push when they want to see, for example, how a new word is pronounced. They simply push the FUNetix button within the game or story and the diacritics magically appear. We call this button, the \\\"Magic Decoder.\\\" But you can only use the \\\"Magic Decoder\\\" if you know the \\\"Secret Code.\\\" Children who know the Secret Code can push the Magic Decoder button whenever they want to unlock the pronunciation of ANY English word. That&rsquo;s FUNetix! Your child will come out of the app reading at about a 2nd grade level, and they will be ready to accelerate at lightning speed into all things written, including books, stories, and grade level course material. If your child is already in 3rd grade or higher, they will now have the fundamental reading skills they need to quickly catch up to their grade level course material. The app works because it teaches \\\"phonological (sound) awareness\\\" FIRST, allowing the developing brain to create a \\\"neural map\\\" of the 44 unique sounds of English via the use of child-friendly, pictograms, or, \\\"sound symbols.\\\" The app works because it first shows children that each sound can be represented as a symbol; and then it shows children that these sound symbols can be blended together to form the very same words that we use in our everyday conversations. Children begin to recognize that sound symbols are the pictorial representations of our spoken language, and the fundamental building blocks of written code. The app works because it introduces English much later in the reading process (4 hours later). English spelling patterns like \\\"ee\\\" and \\\"ea,\\\" etc. are equated to one of the 44 building blocks of sound that the student is now already familiar with. When the app introduces English, it does so by showing children ALL of the pieces of a given word and how the sound of each piece (\\\"phonics\\\") is easily revealed by the Magic Decoder (the diacritic symbols they already know, strategically positioned above the word.) The app works because it teaches ALL of the fundamentals of reading in the RIGHT order. And the app works because it provides children with a \\\"touch of the button\\\" pronunciation guide, and teaches them how to interpret that pronunciation guide. It&rsquo;s like a set of training wheels. Children learn using the diacritics, but once they have seen a word a few times, they no longer need them. By the end of the app, children are essentially weaned off of the diacritics except where new, \\\"novel\\\" words are introduced, words that they have never seen before. For new words, students always have the FUNetix button available so they never have to ask a parent or teacher or older sibling how to decode it. They can do it themselves! And if it&rsquo;s a word they already know the meaning of, they immediately make the association and UNDERSTAND the context in which it is being used. So if you have 12 hours that you would like to donate to this cause, we are looking for up to 1,000 early users. We hope that you and your child have an incredible experience learning how to read with the patented \\\"FUNetix 12 Hour Literacy App!\\\" And we hope that your child becomes a lifelong reader like so many other children who have learned how to read using the FUNetix curriculum. And we hope that your candid feedback will help us make this app as fun and interesting and enjoyable as possible for millions of children who will use it after Thanksgiving, 2020. And of course this is all FREE. We are a 501 (c) (3) charitable non-profit, and we are giving this app away to the world, for FREE! That&rsquo;s our purpose and our mission!

Feel free to also check us out on our website to learn more about us at www.TEACH4Kids.org Who We Are: TEACH (Together Educating All Children in Hospitals) is an international not-for-profit organization that brings exciting, hands-on, STEM educational programming to children in hospitals. Our mission is to create an outlet for children of all ages to passionately engage with the sciences through the medium of fun, interactive experiments. Through engagement with practical science concepts, the children are challenged yet empowered. They emerge comforted and confident, encouraged to successfully cope with the trials that lie before them. TEACH modules challenge children to think creatively and bring an element of fun to an otherwise monotonous day. When TEACH volunteers visit, children get excited and get to experience STEM topics through more than 75 different interactive modules. Patients can learn about real life concepts while also having an exceptional amount of fun. They are amazed as they create silly putty while they learn about polymers and use basic engineering principles to build boats that really float. Observing the science of physiological respiration using yeast to inflate a balloon or discovering density by creating their very own lava lamps truly changes the way they view science, their stay in the hospital and life. What makes us special is that TEACH was founded by and is entirely run by students. In Spring 2013, TEACH&rsquo;s two co-founders were inspired to help with the need for interaction and activity, the craving for a personal bond, and the lack of mental and physical stimulation exhibited by hospitalized children. Under the mentorship and guidance of Dr. Edward Burns of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, TEACH was created to heal through teaching. TEACH began with monthly modules in a local Bronx hospital. In just over a year, TEACH grew to reach nine hospitals with hundreds of students signed up to volunteer from various universities around the tristate area. We have served over 3000 children, 30 hospitals internationally, and 1000 volunteers. What TEACH Needs TEACH is seeking an enthusiastic and passionate individual that wants to make a difference in the lives of medically ill children. We need someone who is committed to the organization both in the time they commit to as well as a financial responsibility to support the organization. Our Advisory board members are required to be active within the organization and play a significant role in the growth of the organization. Advisory Board Member Responsibilities TEACH Advisory board will meet periodically and communicates via email and phone at various times throughout the year. Advisory Board members are required to assist fundraising efforts and participate in at least one committee. Some of the things that they would need to participate in would be to promote events, participate in peer to peer campaigns, help with corporate partnerships and networking.

As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences.

Guiding Principles As a board member, I understand that I owe duties of care, loyalty, and obedience to the organization and the children it serves. The duty of care is the duty to monitor Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s activities, see that its mission is being accomplished, and guard its financial resources. The duty of loyalty is the duty to avoid conflicts of interest. The duty of obedience is to be faithful to Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s mission and to comply with the law. I will uphold these duties and do my utmost to ensure that Maya&rsquo;s Hope performs its mission and achieves its goals. Principal Commitments Act with integrity and represent the interests of all people served by the organization. Recognize that decisions of the board can be made only by a majority vote at a) a board meeting or b) in writing. Respect the majority decisions of the board. Participate in: Board self-evaluation programs. Board development workshops, seminars, and other educational events that enhance skills as a board member. Handle information with discretion and confidentiality as necessary. Exercise authority as a board member only when acting in a meeting with the full board or as delegated by the board with members. Collaborate with members who serve this board and leave personal prejudices out of all board discussions. Represent Maya&rsquo;s Hope in a positive and supportive manner at all times. Display courteous conduct at all board and committee meetings. Refrain from intruding on administrative issues that are the responsibility of management, except to monitor the results of the organization. Monitor the financial condition of the organization. Understand and comply with the bylaws of Maya&rsquo;s Hope. Avoid conflicts of interest between my position as a board member and my personal or professional life (as referenced in Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s Conflict of Interest Policy.) If such a conflict does arise, I will disclose that conflict to the board and refrain from voting on matters in which I have conflict. Liability of Board Members As a fully incorporated non-profit, Maya&rsquo;s Hope enjoys the same limited liability that any corporation does. Corporations offer the protection of limited liability to corporate directors and officers. Limited liability means that the organization's directors and officers have limited personal liability for business debts. Generally, creditors can only go after corporate assets and insurance to satisfy liabilities incurred by the corporation. This principle applies, however, only when the board has fulfilled its basic duties, such as the duty of care. A board member is legally bound to exercise reasonable care when he or she makes a decision for the organization. Reasonable care is what an 'ordinarily prudent' person in a similar situation would do. Examples of when a board member may have personal liability include (but are not limited to) when a board member: personally and directly injures someone. personally guarantees a bank loan or a business debt on which the corporation defaults, or behaves in a fraudulent or illegal manner that causes harm, Maya&rsquo;s Hope maintains a Directors & Officers liability insurance policy. Responsibilities of Secretary: Meeting Minutes The primary task of the secretary of an executive board is to record and maintain the minutes of each board meeting. Meeting minutes are detail reports that highlight the predetermined agenda of each conference as well as what actually took place. For example, a secretary may notate the following: \\\"The meeting began at 11 a.m. The first order of business was for the president to discuss potential changes to the organization&rsquo;s mission statement; however, he was unable to attend the gathering due to medical reasons. The issue was put on hold until a later date.\\\" Record Maintenance As the custodian of corporate records, the secretary of an executive board must maintain all company files in a manner compliant with organizational policies as well as any laws that regulate the industry. These documents may include the firm&rsquo;s article of incorporation, bylaws and employee contact lists, as well as financial records. He must also develop and enforce policies regarding access to these confidential files. Security controls, such as who can access which files and what approvals are needed to do so, are examples of the many procedures he must implement. Depending on the industry in which the company does business, the secretary of the executive board may be required to file certain documents with the government. For example, a nonprofit organization must meet certain criteria to maintain its tax-exempt status. It is often the responsibility of the secretary to ensure that all necessary paperwork is completed and returned to the Internal Revenue Service. Organizational Representative It is not uncommon for the secretary of an executive board to serve as its signing officer. This designation gives her the authority to sign documents, such as contracts, checks and credit applications, on behalf of the organization. Because this responsibility wields so much power, many firms implement a system of checks and balances so it is not abused. For instance, before signing a service agreement, the secretary may need the express written permission of two other board members. She must follow these guidelines or risk termination and, in severe cases, criminal prosecution.", "title": "Board Member Opening at Maya's Hope", "zipcode": "10001", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D2862432%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "Maya's Hope"}, {"end": null, "description": "Inspire girls to explore the possibilities of technology!

This is an outstanding leadership opportunity in an innovative start-up nonprofit organization. About ClassWish ClassWish is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in NYC and working nationwide. Our initial focus was in providing resources for K-12 students. We are now turning attention to help generate funds for nonprofits and for college tuition and textbooks, as well. We offer high-achieving students unparalleled opportunities to assume responsibility, use their skills, gain experience, and make a difference--and provide relief from the cost of college tuition and textbooks. Here are the problems we are tackling: We are tackling two problems at once: Nonprofits need far more funding to fulfill their missions, and schools need far more resources for kids (books, computers, art supplies, musical instruments, science equipment, and sports equipment are all in desperately short supply). Students and their families are burdened by the skyrocketing cost of college tuition and textbooks. (By the way, be sure to see www.TuitionRevolution.org). Our Approach ClassWish is launching a new initiative to address these needs. Soon, students and their families will be able to earn an average of 8% of what they spend at stores, grocers, gas stations, restaurants, hotels, and airlines, and they will be able to direct that to their favorite schools, teachers, nonprofits, or even their own tuition and textbooks. What Campus Reps Will Do ClassWish Campus Reps will help raise awareness of this opportunity for students, professors, and their families to generate funding for schools, nonprofits, and college tuition. We will recruit a campus rep on each college campus.

FAQ - Review ClassWish.org&rsquo;s outstanding internship program here: Is this a business or a nonprofit? ClassWish is a nonprofit, but we use the latest techniques from the business world to make a leveraged, scalable and financially-self sustaining difference in the lives of tens of millions of children. This sounds ambitious! Daniel Burnham, the great Chicago architect, said \\\"Make no little plans; they have not the power to stir men&rsquo;s souls.\\\" (Nor women&rsquo;s, we hasten to add). Little plans also do not have the power to provide a better education to 56 million kids who deserve more than they are getting today. We face a crushing need in schools, have a solid plan to address it, and with your help, we intend to grow this very large and very fast. Where are you located? We are in Manhattan, conveniently located right across from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. Four express subway stops, LIRR, and the PATH train are all within one block. We also hire interns to work remotely from other cities. What skills and experience are you looking for? We seek a wide range of skills: graphic designers, videographers, writers, researchers, creative thinkers, analytical sorts, community organizers, social media stars, people with great communication skills, MBA students, and more. I looked at your site and have some suggestions. Great! This is a collaborative project, and we want to hear from you. Your ClassWish review will be helpful. Is this a paid internship? We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your rsum, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions. Do check to see if your school offers a stipend program. When will you select the interns? We&rsquo;re agile. When we see a great candidate, we extend an invitation immediately. We won&rsquo;t keep you waiting for a decision. What dates will the internship run? We are flexible. Tell us what you are looking for. What are the hours? We welcome full-time and part-time interns. Let us know what works for you. What will I need to bring? Brains, heart, passion, energy, a notebook computer (as an early-stage nonprofit, we just can&rsquo;t afford to buy dozens of machines), and a passion to make an immediate improvement to the education of tens of millions of children.

This sounds ambitious! Daniel Burnham, the great Chicago architect, said \\\"Make no little plans; they have not the power to stir men&rsquo;s souls.\\\" (Nor women&rsquo;s, we hasten to add). Little plans also do not have the power to provide a better education to 56 million kids who deserve more than they are getting today. We face a crushing need in schools, have a solid plan to address it, and with your help, we intend to grow this very large and very fast. Where are you located? We are in Manhattan, conveniently located right across from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. Four express subway stops, LIRR, and the PATH train are all within one block. We also hire interns to work remotely from other cities. What skills and experience are you looking for? We seek a wide range of skills: graphic designers, videographers, writers, researchers, creative thinkers, analytical sorts, community organizers, social media stars, people with great communication skills, MBA students, and more. I looked at your site and have some suggestions. Great! This is a collaborative project, and we want to hear from you. Your ClassWish review will be helpful. Is this a paid internship? We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your rsum, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions. Do check to see if your school offers a stipend program. When will you select the interns? We&rsquo;re agile. When we see a great candidate, we extend an invitation immediately. We won&rsquo;t keep you waiting for a decision. What dates will the internship run? We are flexible. Tell us what you are looking for. What are the hours? We welcome full-time and part-time interns. Let us know what works for you. What will I need to bring? Brains, heart, passion, energy, a notebook computer (as an early-stage nonprofit, we just can&rsquo;t afford to buy dozens of machines), and a passion to make an immediate improvement to the education of tens of millions of children.

Here is an opportunity to help underprivileged children, to help under-served children, to help the more than 55 million children displaced from school due to COVID-19, and even to help many adults who can't read. Here is an opportunity to help close the social inequality gap, by closing the opportunity gap, by closing the education gap, by closing the literacy gap, and by creating a new era of near-100% literacy for the next generation of emerging American school children. We are looking for six, very special people, who have the skills, expertise, experience, passion, and time to be part of something amazing that is about to fundamentally change the lives of millions of children. Right now, millions of children have no hope; but soon, they will have the opportunity to learn how to read, which, in turn, will open a window to education and to a world of potential for them that, not only, has never been opened before, but that has never even been seriously contemplated as a potential reality. What we are talking about is adaptive learning, gamified smartphone app, called FUNetix, that can literally, teach a child how to read, in their own home, in an average of just 12 hours of total use time! We are the American Youth Literacy Foundation, and we have been teaching children how to read for nearly 12 years! We have been developing this app for about two years, and this year we will launch this incredible smartphone app in the App Store and on Google Play by Thanksgiving, 2020, to help save millions of children from a lifetime of illiteracy! Already, there are millions of children who are struggling to learn how to read. Already, there are millions more who have given up on reading and are destined to go through life either completely illiterate, or with semi-literate skills at best. And now with the displacement of tens of millions of children from school, for an indeterminate amount of time , the loss of reading capacity of the next generation presents a new, watershed moment in American education; this can either be a crisis, and a very real threat to the future success of millions of young students, or it can become an opportunity to change the American education landscape forever , by bringing literacy to millions of children who would otherwise have continued down the same path of scarcity and deprivation as so many generations before them. So many people are asking for \\\"Real Solutions\\\" now, not just talk, or continued, seemingly never-ending \\\"conversations\\\" about social reform. At the American Youth Literacy Foundation, we believe that literacy itself, second only to family and faith, is the single most \\\"upstream\\\" component parts of that \\\"Real Solution;\\\" and that literacy is the underpinning of all education; and that education is the key to every individual's opportunity for self-actualization, and the only truly scaleable, truly proven \\\"ticket\\\" out of the oppressive burden of poverty. We are partnered with an engineering team that was one of the five, $1 million finalists, in the XPrize for Global Learning competition (the winners of which were announced last May), which was a worldwide competition for app \\\"design and development\\\" teams to design, build and deliver a tablet-based app to children in remote villages in Africa which could teach them how to read and do basic math (children of all ages, most of whom had never been to school before in their lives). The Xprize competition was incredibly successful at bringing awareness and attention to the use of technology as a potential equalizer in the world of education. The curriculum that our app is based on is a patented reading decoding system , and is so effective at teaching children how to read, that it usually only takes 4-6 hours for them to understand the basic learning tools, and another 4-6 hours for them to reach a 2nd grade reading level. Compare this to so many of our students who have been in the public school system for 6 years and still can't spell simple words like \\\"the, said, was, would, could, there or through.\\\" Compare this to millions of students who have dropped out of school, primarily because they can't read ( more than 10 million per decade (24% according to U.S. Government statistics)). More than 20 million children in grades 3-12 in America's public schools today are either completely or functionally illiterate, according to the U.S. Government&rsquo;s \\\"Annual Report Card.\\\" Our organization is a 12-year-old, nationwide, charitable 501 c 3 non-profits founded in 2008. We started out as a regional tutoring program, then became a nationwide tutoring program; but all the while, our focus has always been on finding a scalable solution to the literacy crisis in America. With the rise of the smartphone and the amazing penetration of this powerful tool (more than 80% in even the most impoverished communities), we feel that the answer we have been searching for IS in the form of an app. So for the past several years, we have been working to convert our amazing reading curriculum that teaches children how to read in 12 hours, into an app that teaches children how to read in 12 hours. And this is where you come in. We have more than 50 people working to build, test, and deliver this app to millions of children in America's inner cities and rural communities, to the barrios and the suburbs and the American Indian reservations and everywhere in-between. But in order to do this, we need to reach the people who need it the most. And in order to reach those people and those communities, we need to hear from you, and people like you who live in those communities. We need to better understand the current state of the schools and the education system at the local level in your neighborhood, town or city. We need to more fully understand the specific challenges that illiteracy and low literacy have burdened your community with, so that we can more fully develop a workable tactical plan to reverse the literacy crisis and lift those burdens, using the FUNetix Reading App. The FUNetix curriculum is approximately 12 hours and 2,000 screens that take a child from the ABC's to a 2nd-grade reading level. Children learn the fundamentals of letters and sounds and how to blend sound symbols together to form words and sentences. The app uses a super-child-friendly, phonetic code called 21E, that makes it easy to learn how to read. The FUNetix Reading System is patented and uses a special diacritic decoding system to show children the irregular spelling patterns of English, and especially how to pronounce any English word. At the American Youth Literacy Foundation, our goal is to bring the FUNetix Reading App to children who are not learning how to read in school, either because they are in schools that are failing, or because they are in difficult situations at home for a variety of reasons. Many parents are desperate for an education solution for their children, but the challenge of teaching reading to children is too great for teachers with classes of up to 40 children or more, combined with a typical \\\"off the shelf\\\" reading curriculum that is confusing and doesn&rsquo;t scale. Children get lost, confused, frustrated and bored; and many of them act out, forcing teachers to focus on classroom management as opposed to classroom learning. The REAL literacy rates in so many thousands of America&rsquo;s elementary schools are 20% or less in 3rd grade and beyond! But it doesn't have to be that way; and FUNetix is going to change ALL of this, soon! The role of a Community Liaison is as a connector. You will help Youth Lit connect to your community and many hundreds of other communities across the United States by reaching out to understand exactly how the literacy crisis is affecting people in those communities, and by finding out what specific solutions they desire, and how best we can bring our literacy app into the homes and minds of the children who need it most. A Community Liaison is someone who is passionate about ending the literacy crisis in America, and finally creating that \\\"Equal Playing Field\\\" that everyone has been talking about for so long. But a Community Liaison also brings key ideas and action steps that they believe can be taken in order to make that happen. Such steps may involve working with specific people in the community, advertising at select locations, connecting with specific organizations, or otherwise finding ways to reach the parents and children that are most in need of a new solution to reading and education. Working together, we will radically, positively impact communities all across the United States, by bringing \\\"Literacy for All\\\" to the next generation of emerging learners. We are looking for six intelligent, creative, outgoing, enthusiastic, cheerful, optimistic individuals with significant real-world experience and a willingness to both talk to and listen to people, and to identify ways to best share the benefits of our app with those children in need. This is a complex undertaking and we are looking for highly proficient and organized professional-minded individuals who have a track record of success in creating positive outcomes in their communities, and who are willing to reach beyond, to other communities like their own, to bring change across America. The specific action step that we need you to take now is to complete a google form that will be sent to you if you express interest in this position by hitting the \\\"I'm interested\\\" button. Just to be clear, our organization is an all-volunteer, mission-centric, extended virtual network, comprised of highly skilled and experienced individuals from around the country (and a few from around the world) who collaborate through cloud-based technology and platforms. Individuals interested in this position must have the confidence and ability to work in a virtual environment (as well as on the street and on the ground) using select networking and communications tools and platforms. Given the current \\\"social distancing\\\" environment that we find ourselves in, individuals must also be willing to pick up the phone, send out emails, schedule Zoom meetings and use other communications technologies to contact and build relationships within our target audience. Thank you! We hope we have given you enough information about who we are and what our mission and goals are; and we hope that this opportunity finds you at the right place and the right time in your career to make a difference and an impact, in an amazing way, for millions of children who are waiting for someone, or something, to lead them out of a life of impoverishment and into a future of unlimited possibility and potential.

Here is an opportunity to help underprivileged children, to help under-served children, to help ALL children displaced from school by COVID-19, to help close the opportunity gap in America, by closing the education gap, by closing the literacy gap that looms large, like an impassable crevasse, separating the haves from the have-nots, the rich, the almost rich, the upper middle class, even the middle class, from the more than 100 million lower class, lower middle class, working class poor, impoverished and underprivileged Americans. We are looking for a few very special people, with fundraising, particularly, crowdsourcing expertise, either in the corporate or non-profit arena, who have the skills, expertise, experience, passion, and time to be part of something amazing that is about to fundamentally change the lives of millions of children. Right now, millions of children have no hope; but soon, they will have the opportunity to learn how to read, which, in turn, will open a window to education and to a world of potential for them that, not only, has never been opened before, but that has never even been seriously contemplated as a viable, potential reality. What we are talking about is an adaptive learning, gamified smartphone app, called FUNetix (www.FUNetix.org), that can teach children how to read, in their own home, in an average of just 12 hours of total instruction time! We are the American Youth Literacy Foundation, and we have been teaching children how to read for 12 years using a patented \\\"reading decoding system!\\\" We have been developing this app for about two years (but started concepting and working on prototypes almost five years ago); and this year we will launch this incredible smartphone app in the App Store and on Google Play at or around Thanksgiving, 2020, to help save millions of children from a lifetime of illiteracy! Already, there are millions of children who are struggling to learn how to read. Already, there are millions more who have given up on reading and are destined to go through life either completely illiterate, or with only semi-literate skills at best. And now with the displacement of 55 million children from school, for an indeterminate amount of time, the loss of reading capacity of the next generation, and the \\\"seemingly incessant,\\\" \\\"widening of the gap,\\\" presents a new \\\"crisis moment\\\" in American education, and a very real threat to the future success (in school, and in life) of millions of young children. But we believe there IS a way to bridge that gap, to make this a \\\"watershed moment\\\" instead of a crisis moment, by stopping that gap from widening. Universal access to literacy through FUNetix will close the opportunity gap by closing the education gap by closing the literacy gap to near zero. What happens after that, can only be imagined: a virtuous cycle of communication and learning, perhaps, between teachers and students, in ALL of America&rsquo;s schools and classrooms. And what happens after that? An entire generation of nearly 100% literate young people of all races, religions, creeds, cultures and socioeconomic backgrounds will, quite inevitably, reform the social fabric of the American landscape for the good, and for the benefit of innumerable generations to come. According to the U.S. Government&rsquo;s \\\"Annual Report Card,\\\" more than 20 million children in grades 3-12, in America's public schools today, can't read at anything close to a proficient level! Translated into \\\"English,\\\" that means they are either completely illiterate (\\\"Below Basic:\\\" 24%), or functionally illiterate/ semi-literate (\\\"Basic:\\\" 43%). Fully more than half of all America&rsquo;s public-school-educated children have between zero and minimal literacy skills. This travesty exists in spite of the fact that, as a nation, we spend more than $11,000 per year, per student, to deliver a public school \\\"education.\\\" Just over 24% of all students drop out of public school, most of them in 9th grade. That's 1 million per year! Since the year 2000, America has \\\"graduated\\\" more than 20 million illiterate \\\"students\\\" into the U.S. economy, into our socio-economic and socio-political marketplace of ideas without hope, and without basic survival skills. Without literacy, and without education, these young people have practically zero chance at fulfilling their personal potential; and economic security is simply unattainable. That&rsquo;s all about to change! The American Youth Literacy Foundation, dba FUNetix, is a 12 year old, nationwide, charitable 501 (c) (3) non-profit. We started out as a tutoring program in the regional Philadelphia, Central New Jersey area and we still provide some one-on-one tutoring. But our focus has always been on finding a scalable solution to the literacy crisis in America. With the rise of the smartphone and the amazing penetration of this incredibly powerful, and ubiquitously critical tool (currently estimated at 80%), even into the most impoverished communities in America, we realized several years ago, that the answer to scalability we had been searching for, was going to be in the form of an app. So for the past several years we have been working to convert our amazing reading curriculum, that teaches children how to read in an average of just 12 hours, into an app that teaches children how to read in about the same time. And this is where you come in. The curriculum that our app is based on is a patented reading decoding system, and is so effective at teaching children how to read, that it usually only takes 4-6 hours for them to understand the basic reading-learning system, (which includes a FUN, but intensive introduction to all 44 sounds of the English language, and the basic concept of blending sound symbols into words), and another 4-6 hours for them to reach a 2nd grade reading level! On, or about, Thanksgiving, 2020, we will deliver this incredible reading app to the App Store and Google Play, and with it, an end-user experience (the UX) to millions of children in America's inner cities and rural counties, in the barrios and the suburbs, and on the American Indian reservations, and everywhere in-between, where illiteracy is endemic and education and opportunity are, tragically, not universally attainable. FUNetix will make a profound impact on millions of individual lives, while also profoundly effecting major social improvement on a massive scale, to bring about real, sustainable change in underprivileged and fully privileged communities and classrooms alike, wherever illiteracy and poor literacy looms. Literacy as a path to education and opportunity for millions of American children, and potentially billions of children worldwide, is imminently near. Through FUNetix, the American Youth Literacy Foundation is making English accessible to everyone! The curriculum consists of more than 2,000, individually narrated screens. We first teach children the 44 sounds of the English language. Then we teach them how to \\\"map,\\\" or, associate symbols to each of these sounds. We teach them how to blend those sound symbols and those sounds together to make words and sentences and, ultimately, stories. It usually takes them only 4 hours to learn how to read our super child-friendly, phonetic English code called 21E. Over the next 4 hours, children learn how to use those sound symbols as a \\\"diacritic\\\" pronunciation guide to help them decode ANY English word. We call this the FUNetix Magic Decoder, because it works like magic: the magic symbols above the words reveal the hidden sounds of EVERY English word! FUNetix, the team, is a mission-focused, distributed network of currently, 51 people (and still growing), each contributing between 5 and 65 hours of volunteer time per week. The FUNetix organization is organized into 12 teams including Project Management, Graphic Design, Curriculum Development, UX/Beta Testing, Engineering, Community Outreach and Distribution, Web Development, Funding, Marketing, Communications and Public Relations, and others. There's much more to tell. You can read more about our story, and about us, at www.FUNetix.org and www.YouthLit.org. We have much more to do to get ready for our Thanksgiving launch! As for our Crowdsourcing Experts, we are looking for three, very special people, who have everything we mentioned above: passion, expertise, time, etc., to join our team and help us launch the FUNetix Reading App this fall. The ideal candidate will have a broad, deep and sophisticated understanding of, and experience in, raising money through social media and crowdsourcing sites like Kickstarter and GoFundMe, among others. Ultimately, our mission is to get the app, and via the app, literacy, out to the children who need it most; and for that, we still require significant funding to finish the app and implement our initial marketing and distribution strategy. We believe that with the right messaging, we will find potentially tens of thousands of people willing to help with this incredible cause and this incredible effort, by contributing small amounts. Our current needs for finishing the app and executing our marketing and distribution strategy fall between $100K and $200k; so this is not an insignificant amount. But the goal is to utilize this second round of funding to allow us to develop additional revenue streams that will take us forward into the future and allow us to continue to bring the, absolutely FREE, FUNetix 12 Hour Reading App to millions of children both in the U.S., and around the world. in many ways, our Thanksgiving launch will be more of a beginning than an end. It will be the beginning of a tireless effort to deliver the solution to the streets and homes and schools of America where children are trying, but endlessly failing at learning how to read. If you wish to be considered for this opportunity, please send us a cover letter and resume to HR@YouthLit.org, and tell us about your crowdsourcing and fundraising experience. We are looking for intelligent, creative, enthusiastic, cheerful, optimistic individuals, who have the time, energy, expertise and desire to make a true difference and be part of something amazing! This is a complex undertaking and we are looking for highly proficient and organized professionals. Individuals interested in this position must have the experience and ability to work in a virtual environment using select networking, file sharing, and communications tools and platforms, and must have extensive knowledge and experience in crowdsourcing websites and campaigns. Thank you! We hope this opportunity finds you at the right place and the right time in your career to make a difference and an impact, to add value, in an amazing way, to help millions of children who are waiting for someone, or some thing, to lead them out of a life of impoverishment and into a future of unlimited possibility and potential.

DID YOU KNOW 90% OF LATINA GIRLS WANT TO BE LEADERS BUT ONLY 10% OF GIRLS FEEL SHE HAS WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A LEADER? YOU can change this! The Girl Scout experience gives every girl the confidence and personal leadership skills she needs to realize her full potential. Girl Scouts are more successful in school, relationships, and careers; and they achieve more for their families, their community, and their country than non-Girl Scouts. By bringing together girls from different cultures, Girl Scouts gives them a place to celebrate their own heritage and learn about others, which creates a sense of pride and understanding. Both qualities-pride and understanding-serve girls well throughout their lives. Who can start a troop? Just about anyone! Parents, teachers, professionals, college students, military personnel, women or men. As a new leader, you&rsquo;ll receive plenty of training and resources to get started - no experience required. What&rsquo;s the leader's role? With the help of a strong support team and useful materials, a leader holds meetings for their troop of girls. Meetings are an hour or two, and usually consist of skill-building and badge earning activities. Leaders also communicate with troop parents and their local Girl Scout support team for any help they might need. How much time will this take? It's up to you! You decide how many times your troop meets. The time you give as a troop leader is valuable to us, and we'll give you tools that let you make the most of it. On average, leaders commit five hours per month, with room to grow if you choose to do additional activities.

The Comprehensive Community Hospice Program of Parker Jewish Institute is looking for people who would like to volunteer as a doula, going out to patients' homes and extending the hand of reassurance, offering a smile that warms the heart, and the words that say everything will be okay. Volunteer Doulas will help patients and families cope with the process of dying, remaining at the bedside as life ends. \\\"Doula\\\" is a Greek word that means \\\"woman servant or caregiver.\\\" Today it is associated with individuals who provide physical assistance and emotional support during and/or after childbirth. This proposed program aims to mirror the concept by providing the same type of support at the final phase of a terminal illness. This initiative will place a focus on planning for death with the elderly patient and family if there is one, and will provide a continuous around the clock vigil as death becomes imminent. The program will help the elderly patient who lacks family or adequate caregiver support to die comfortably, without fear of being alone. Even when surrounded by loved ones, individuals with a terminal illness and those closest to them may feel isolated as they face the end of life. As the end of life approaches, patients and families struggle with anxiety and fear; exhaustion; loved ones often feel alone, unprepared and afraid; and opportunities to explore meaning go unaddressed. Hospice Doulas provide emotional support and comfort to patients and their loved ones in the final phase of a terminal illness. Our End-of-Life (EOL) Doula volunteers will receive thorough training in understanding the dying process and in the skills that help bring peace and comfort to all involved. This free two-day training includes learning how to do guided visualization, help create rituals, provide simple physical support, offer sacred presence, as well as how to create spiritual and emotional legacies. Parker Jewish institute will be hosting a free two-day Doula training workshop on Saturday 10/28/17 and Sunday 10/29/17 from 9:00am-6:00pm. Breakfast and lunch will be served. A certificate will be awarded upon completion of this workshop. If you are interested in attending, please call the Hospice Program's Volunteer Doula Coordinator at 718-289-2134, or email volunteer-nerken@parkerinstitute.org. Doulas can come from any background and no experience is required. They typically work in as part of a team. They usually sit quietly with a patient, talk with them and offer support, comfort and companionship.

Earn a certificate of completion that can build your resume, support a career change, and or be used toward high school or college community service requirements (depending on your county). Become someone who is better equipped to make a difference in your community and the world at large through the powerful tools of organizing and advocacy Logistics The Activist Training Lab program will begin in September 2020 and conclude in August 2021. We expect participants to commit to the entire year. The program requires ~10 hours per month. Webinars (2 hours) will occur twice a month (every other week). Between the webinars there will be opportunities to get hands-on practice with the skills you have learned and receive one-on-one support and mentorship. The program is completed entirely online and through work in your own community. And the Activist Training Lab is 100% free - no fees. Who Can Apply You must be 16 years of age or older. You must live in the United States. This is not for professional environmental advocates or organizers (meaning you currently work or have significant professional experience in this field). This program is designed for people who are volunteer activists or want to become volunteer activists, or who are hoping to start a career in environmental organizing but have not yet. We believe that biodiversity loss disproportionately impacts the most marginalized people in our society, and we believe vulnerable communities must be centered in the work we do. We especially encourage you to apply if you identify with a community that has traditionally been marginalized in the environmental movement and society at large, including (but not limited to) people of color, Indigenous peoples, youth, seniors, and LGBTQ+ , low-income, rural, and immigrant communities. How Do I Apply? You can apply by visiting https://www.endangered.org/activist-training-lab/ and sending in an application by July 1st, 2020. You will receive information about the status of your application by July 17th, 2020. We will carefully select the strongest applicants to move on to interviews conducted over phone and video chat. The strongest applicants will: Demonstrate a clear interest in protecting biodiversity and advancing environmental justice Demonstrate a clear interest in building skills of grassroots organizing and mobilization Be enthusiastic about committing to a year-long program Be excited to learn through both webinars and hands-on work in your community Be committed to learning in a diverse community and respecting people of different identities and backgrounds Who&rsquo;s Running The Program? The Activist Training Lab is directed by Sarah Starman, the National Grassroots Organizer with the Endangered Species Coalition.

Feel free to also check us out on our website to learn more about us at www.TEACH4Kids.org Who We Are: TEACH (Together Educating All Children in Hospitals) is an international not-for-profit organization that brings exciting, hands-on, STEM educational programming to children in hospitals. Our mission is to create an outlet for children of all ages to passionately engage with the sciences through the medium of fun, interactive experiments. Through engagement with practical science concepts, the children are challenged yet empowered. They emerge comforted and confident, encouraged to successfully cope with the trials that lie before them. TEACH modules challenge children to think creatively and bring an element of fun to an otherwise monotonous day. When TEACH volunteers visit, children get excited and get to experience STEM topics through more than 75 different interactive modules. Patients can learn about real life concepts while also having an exceptional amount of fun. They are amazed as they create silly putty while they learn about polymers and use basic engineering principles to build boats that really float. Observing the science of physiological respiration using yeast to inflate a balloon or discovering density by creating their very own lava lamps truly changes the way they view science, their stay in the hospital and life. What makes us special is that TEACH was founded by and is entirely run by students. In Spring 2013, TEACH&rsquo;s two co-founders were inspired to help with the need for interaction and activity, the craving for a personal bond, and the lack of mental and physical stimulation exhibited by hospitalized children. Under the mentorship and guidance of Dr. Edward Burns of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, TEACH was created to heal through teaching. TEACH began with monthly modules in a local Bronx hospital. In just over a year, TEACH grew to reach nine hospitals with hundreds of students signed up to volunteer from various universities around the tristate area. We have served over 3000 children, 30 hospitals internationally, and 1000 volunteers. What TEACH Needs TEACH is seeking an enthusiastic and passionate individual that wants to make a difference in the lives of medically ill children. We need someone who is committed to the organization both in the time they commit to as well as a financial responsibility to support the organization. Our Advisory board members are required to be active within the organization and play a significant role in the growth of the organization. Advisory Board Member Responsibilities TEACH Advisory board will meet periodically and communicates via email and phone at various times throughout the year. Advisory Board members are required to assist fundraising efforts and participate in at least one committee. Some of the things that they would need to participate in would be to promote events, participate in peer to peer campaigns, help with corporate partnerships and networking.
