Blue Engine recruits, trains, and matches a team of three BETAs with a teacher in ELA or algebra in 8th, 9th, or 10th grades (where Blue Engine currently focuses). More adults in the classroom reduces the teacher to student ratio from about 30:1 to 6:1 enabling teachers to build authentic relationships with students, provides significantly more instructional hours during class and before/after school, and differentiates, individualizes, and personalizes instruction. The teacher-BETA collaboration enables daily student-centered reflection and learning that improves teacher practice. No student goes unseen or heard. At the same time, Blue Engine's hybrid model helps a diverse, local wave of educators enter the teaching profession through an apprenticeship (as a BETA and AmeriCorps member), teaching alongside a team for one or two years with the opportunity to earn their teaching credential in their second year through Relay Graduate School of Education. Blue Engine is more than an \\\"equal opportunity employer.\\\" We acknowledge the roles we play as educators and leaders in the very tangible systems of oppression and racism that exist in our communities and classrooms and strive to be an actively anti-racist organization. We believe that by assembling diverse and inclusive teams, we can build alliances that fundamentally disrupt and dismantle these systems at their root. Desired Skills Is curious about an apprenticeship model to implement a team teaching approach within public middle and high school classrooms Is motivated by building relationships and working on a team Is interested in collaborating with others and learning & developing through feedback Is flexible and can adapt to the often fast paced and changing school environment Qualifications Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree.

You must have a cumulative 2.50 GPA on a 4.00 scale from an accredited college or university upon graduation. US Citizenship or National / Permanent Resident Status.

BETAs complete four weeks of training in August and receive consistent support throughout the school year. While they are not the lead teacher in the classroom, BETAs are responsible for many of the same things, including attending meetings, preparing for lessons, tutoring, grading, attending school events, and making parent phone calls. Upon completing the year of service, BETAs have the option to stay for a second year as a Team Coordinator, where they manage a team of BETAs, and can choose to enroll in Blue Engine&rsquo;s teacher residency program at Relay Graduate School of Education to become a certified, full-time teacher.

Help us capture for nonprofits providing disaster relief some of the $450 billion Americans spend each year buying presents. (We also have internships for those interested in other causes). Become a member of our dynamic and creative international team. Help us grow a movement to facilitate and encourage a new type of meaningful giving through direct engagement of nonprofits, foundations, associations, thought leaders, media, and celebrities.

Focus on Disaster Relief-or Your Other Favorite Cause At ChangingThePresent you can focus on Disaster Relief or any other favorite cause About ChangingThePresent.org The New York Times called ChangingThePresent.org an \\\"amazon.com of the nonprofit world\\\" for our work in helping 400 leading nonprofits capture some of the fortune normally spent on traditional presents. While a million nonprofits desperately need more funds to accomplish their missions, Americans spend $450 billion a year on birthday, holiday, and other presents. Most of those presents are not very rewarding. Tons of sweaters, fuzzy slippers, and ties end up in the dark corners of our closets. It is no surprise that a growing number of people, who seek meaning more than \\\"stuff,\\\" are starting to show their love by donating in a friend&rsquo;s name in lieu of giving traditional presents. The challenge for nonprofits is that it is simply too daunting to provide the requisite gift-like experience (tangible charitable gifts, wish lists and registries, and personalized printed greeting cards) that can make a donation feel like a rewarding gift. ChangingThePresent.org provides those tools to facilitate this type of giving for nonprofits and donors. We are about to take ChangingThePresent to the next level. That involves expanding from the initial 400 organizations to inviting all 1.1 million nonprofits, as well as adding additional causes and categories. Within each cause area, we will seek growth funding, invite advisors, recruit nonprofits, use media and social media to raise awareness among the public, and recruit celebrities to lend their voices. Imagine the impact we can make together as more and more people adopt this type of meaningful gift-giving! Casual and Friendly Office Environment This is a great place to work. We have had interns and volunteers from all over the United States and more than fifty countries. The atmosphere is energetic, creative, and fun. We value brainstorming, initiative, sharing, and collaborating. Think of it is a laboratory, studio, seminar, or incubator. We are also casual.

A pioneering nonprofit, Heifer International, has shown that nonprofits can capture some of that money by making donations, given in a friend&rsquo;s name, feel like a present. It works! They raise $115 million a year this way. Imagine how much more gift money could be captured by nonprofits addressing popular causes, including your favorites. The challenge is that it is too daunting for most nonprofits to provide a gift-like experience: tangible donation opportunities, wish lists, gift registries, and personalized printed greeting cards. About www.ChangingThePresent.org Our nonprofit site provides a gift-like experience, which helps 400 leading nonprofits capture money normally spent on traditional presents. The NY Times called it an \\\"amazon.com of the nonprofit world.\\\" We are now about to invite all million nonprofits to join the site. We are also providing each with their own private, charitable gift sites so they can send supporters without exposing them to other nonprofits. See a sample: http://SampleNGO.GiftsForHumanity.org. We facilitate this type of giving for individuals and nonprofits, and we promote this as a social norm. The Environment This is a great place to work.

One benefit that will be of special interest to the students in China is the opportunity to improve their resume with the addition of a responsible Community Service position that will help them gain admittance to American colleges. About ClassWish.org Here is the problem we are tackling: K-12 schools in this country do not have enough resources to let children explore their potential and excel. Books, computers, art supplies, musical instruments, science equipment, sports equipment, and even paper for computers and printers are all in desperately short supply. Our Approach: ClassWish.org, an exciting new nonprofit, uses modern business practices and the latest marketing techniques to help 125,000 schools serving 56 million kids, inform, inspire and engage supporters. Teachers visit the site to create Wish Lists of the resources they need. People in the community can see exactly what is needed and contribute to help. About Us: We have an innovative and capable team supported by professionals and celebrities. What You Will Get Out of the Experience You will enhance your resume with a solid record of professional achievement in building a very large and innovative new program, you will gain recognition for your community service, and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you have helped children get the tools they need to perform at their best. If you want a great experience doing something you will always be proud of, learn more about this exciting opportunity by reviewing the PowerPoints we have prepared for you. Please see the PowerPoints on our internship opportunities: for the Chinese internship: http://www.classwish-intern-postings.org/chinese-hr.html for our other internships: http://ClassWish-Intern-Postings.org Then, send a cover letter and a resume to interns@ClassWish.org. Impress us. This is competitive. FAQ Is this a business or a nonprofit? We are a nonprofit, but we use the latest techniques from the business world to make a leveraged, scalable and financially-self sustaining difference in the lives of tens of millions of schoolchildren. Where are you located? We are in Manhattan, conveniently located right across from Madison Square Garden. Four express subway stops are within one block. We will also hire interns to work remotely from other cities. I looked at your site and have some suggestions. Great! This is a collaborative project, and we want to hear from everyone. Is this a paid internship? We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your resum\u00e9, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions. What dates will the internship run? We are hiring for the spring semester, for the summer, and beyond. What are the hours? We welcome full-time and part-time interns. Let us know what works for you. Responsibilities We are looking for an outstanding intern to lead the launch of the world&rsquo;s largest Virtual Community Service Program. You will take a leadership role on projects and work with other highly motivated interns, established professionals, and directly with our co-founder. Requirements We are looking for passionate, energetic students with exceptional skills. This is an outstanding leadership opportunity in an innovative start-up nonprofit organization.

We are engaging with the Fashion industry, as follows: We will invite famous fashion designers to participate in the celebrity section of ClassWish. They will get their own page, where they can lend their voice to providing children with art suppleis and other resources; honor their own favorite teacher; and link to other fashion icons who are doing the same. They will also appear on web banner ads that we design specifically for each of them. We will secure donated ad inventory from fashion magazines, websites, blogs, schools, and retailers. The ClassWish PSA ads will feature the celebrities involved in the program. We will build Cause Marketing and promotional campaigns with fashion brands and retailers. For instance, we are working on one campaign now: 'Win a wardrobe for yourself and one for your favorite teacher.&rsquo; We will seek editorial coverage of the campaign from fashion magazines and websites. We will use social media to reinforce these campaigns. We are a small organization, so we seek outstanding students who can take a leadership role. They will work in small teams and with our co-founder and other professionals. The fashion program is a new one for us, so this is a ground-floor opportunity.

Our Approach: ClassWish.org, an exciting new nonprofit, uses modern business practices and the latest marketing techniques to help 125,000 schools serving 56 million kids, inform, inspire and engage supporters. Teachers visit the site to create Wish Lists of the resources they need. People in the community can see exactly what is needed and contribute to help.

FAQ - Review ClassWish.org&rsquo;s outstanding internship program here: Is this a business or a nonprofit? We are a nonprofit, but we use the latest techniques from the business world to make a leveraged, scalable and financially-self sustaining difference in the lives of tens of millions of schoolchildren. This sounds ambitious! Daniel Burnham, the great Chicago architect, said \\\"Make no little plans; they have not the power to stir men&rsquo;s souls.\\\" (Nor women&rsquo;s, we hasten to add). Little plans also do not have the power to provide a better education to 56 million kids who deserve more than they are getting today. We face a crushing need in schools, have a solid plan to address it, and with your help, we intend to grow this very large and very fast. Where are you located? We are in Manhattan, conveniently located right across from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. Four express subway stops, LIRR, and the PATH train are all within one block. We will also hire interns to work remotely from other cities (but for other roles, not bookkeeping). What skills and experience are you looking for? This posting is for a bookkeeping intern. We also seek interns with a wide range of skills: graphic designers, videographers, writers, researchers, creative thinkers, analytical sorts, community organizers, social media stars, people with great communication skills, MBA students, and more. I looked at your site and have some suggestions. Great! This is a collaborative project, and we want to hear from you. Your ClassWish review will be helpful. Is this a paid internship? We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your rsum, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions. Do check to see if your school offers a stipend program. When will you select the interns? We&rsquo;re agile. When we see a great candidate, we extend an invitation immediately. We won&rsquo;t keep you waiting for a decision. What dates will the internship run? We are flexible. Tell us what you are looking for. What are the hours? We welcome full-time and part-time interns. Let us know what works for you. What will I need to bring? Brains, heart, passion, energy, a notebook computer (as an early-stage nonprofit, we just can&rsquo;t afford to buy dozens of machines), and a passion to make an immediate improvement to the education of tens of millions of children. Sounds exciting! How can I apply? Please send a short cover letter and an impressive resume to interns @ ClassWish . org .", "title": "Bookkeeping Internship with ClassWish.org.

We are looking for passionate, energetic students with exceptional skills to take initiative on a range of projects. This is an outstanding leadership opportunity in an innovative start-up nonprofit organization. Here is the problem we are tackling: K-12 schools in this country do not have enough resources to let children explore their potential and excel. Books, computers, art supplies, musical instruments, science equipment, sports equipment, and even paper for computers and printers are all in desperately short supply. Our Approach: ClassWish.org, an exciting new nonprofit, uses modern business practices and the latest marketing techniques to help 125,000 schools serving 56 million kids, inform, inspire and engage supporters. Teachers visit the site to create Wish Lists of the resources they need. People in the community can see exactly what is needed and contribute to help. About Us: The people behind ClassWish.org include such prominent education and business leaders as Adam Hirsch, former COO, Mashable; Laurie Coots, CMO, TBWA; Scott Cutler, EVP, New York Stock Exchange; Betsy Morgan, former CEO, Huffington Post; Nancy Pelz-Paget, Director, Education and Society Program, Aspen Institute; Sharon Robinson, CEO, American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education. Forbes Magazine liked our approach so much that they donated a full page to help raise awareness. Yo-Yo Ma, Tony Hawk and Dwight Howard are among the celebrities who have offered to help promote ClassWish.org. The work: Teachers and students are already getting supplies from ClassWish.org. Now, we need to raise greater awareness and encourage more participation so we can help more kids. Interns will work in small teams focused on such things as: marketing to particular audiences, such as businesses, bloggers, press, educators, moms, religious organizations, civic organizations, unions, nonprofits, authors, soap operas, magazine readers, teens and celebrities marketing around particular school subjects, such as science, music, art, reading and sports marketing around particular promotions (such as http://ClassWish.org/days and http://ClassWish.org/books/124) creating and implementing social media campaigns building and managing relationships with strategic partners such as http://EdRover.com building and leading a national network of volunteers enhancing the website creating graphics and promotional materials You will take leadership on projects and work with other highly motivated interns, established professionals, and directly with our co-founder. What do we offer? You will enhance your resume with a solid record of professional achievement and community service, and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you have helped children get the tools they need to perform at their best. If you want a great experience doing something you will always be proud of, send a cover letter and a resume to interns@ClassWish.org. Impress us. This is competitive. FAQ Is this a business or a nonprofit? ClassWish is a nonprofit, but we use the latest techniques from the business world to make a leveraged, scalable and financially-self sustaining difference in the lives of tens of millions of children. This sounds ambitious! Daniel Burnham, the great Chicago architect, said \\\"Make no little plans; they have not the power to stir men's souls.\\\" (Nor women's, we hasten to add). Little plans also do not have the power to provide a better education to 56 million kids who deserve more than they are getting today. We face a crushing need in schools, have a solid plan to address it, and with your help, we intend to grow this very large and very fast. Where are you located? We are in Manhattan, conveniently located right across from Madison Square Garden. We will also hire interns to work remotely from other cities. What skills and experience are you looking for? We seek a wide range of skills: graphic designers, videographers, writers, researchers, creative thinkers, analytical sorts, community organizers, social media stars, people with great communication skills, MBA students, and more. I looked at your site and have some suggestions. Great! This is a collaborative project, and we want to hear from everyone. Is this a paid internship? We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your resum\u00e9, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions. When will you select the interns? We're agile. When we see a great candidate, we extend an invitation immediately. We won't keep you waiting for a decision. What dates will the internship run? We are hiring for the summer, for the fall semester, and beyond. Tell us what you are looking for. What are the hours? We welcome full-time and part-time interns. Let us know what works for you. What will I need to bring? Brains, heart, passion, energy, a notebook computer, and a passion to make an immediate improvement to the education of tens of millions of children. Sounds exciting!

RSVP for our Information Session for Video Professionals! (See RSVP details below!) Our goal is to put together a volunteer team that can edit the groundbreaking work being done at The Actors Theatre Workshop. Using your professional skills to edit this wonderful material will surely stimulate hope, excitement and I believe bring true enlightenment to those who participate. At the same time you will reach another dimension in your craft as you learn about the unique filming/editing perspective of the ATW Founder and Artistic Director, Thurman E. Scott. ATW has long been on the front lines of disciplined creative training for theater professionals and individuals committed to fulfilling their creative potential. ATW has also been a safe haven for thousands of at-risk and homeless youth. The original theater and educational technique which has been tremendously successful with our professional acting students, has proven to be equally beneficial to the children we teach in our after-school programs. We have many years of footage from our adult acting workshop's and community program's that we want to share with you and the world. We've started sharing this video online and we've received such positive feedback from every corner of the globe that we are taking steps to put out more. This process takes time and so we would like to find more dedicated individuals who want to learn and make a difference in other people's lives and be a part of something hopeful by joining our video editing team. Our editors often talk about the beautiful, inspiring and deeply moving moments they have witnessed when a student actor or a child from a homeless shelter brings forth his talent and reaches for their potential. You literally see the moments when there is a shift in consciousness and they begin to accept their strength and the unique gifts that they have to offer the world. And in that moment you know that this person has changed forever-- and as a result undoubtedly so have you. By working directly with this material you will gain deep insight into the emotional and psychological breakdown of drama, and learn to see the penetrating insights that come out of script analysis, which gives you the ability to find and understand the eternal essence of ideas that are then formulated into a universal idea that helps to instill faith and spread hope to all individuals on a creative journey. So without further ado.. We invite you to a Volunteer Info Session for video editing professionals .To RSVP go to: http://www.actorstheatreworkshop.com, click on \\\"volunteers\\\" and fill out an online application.

This is an intensive Leadership Training Program in non-profit business management. Interns receive hands-on training as a management assistant. If skilled in video, interns may assist in video production and editing at our award-winning theater arts and community service organization. As video production becomes increasingly critical to the growth, development and success of managing a successful non-profit, we seek intern candidates that are leaders who are passionate about non-profit management and posses skills in video production and editing. Successful non-profits are built on powerful ideas that inspire hope. These ideas are manifested in the programs and the management of the organization. By gaining a working understanding of how to successfully manage a nonprofit organization, the intern begins to learn its core principals, which allows the intern to begin to take a leadership role in the organization. In addition, this knowledge is invaluable in the creation of videos that effectively promote and bring this work to the world. These videos are essential to the marketing and fund-raising efforts in any successful non-profit. We are looking for individuals with the ability to lead, manage teams, work independently, communicate effectively on the phone, in person and in writing and interact in a fast-paced business environment. We are looking for idealists and leaders who can put their thoughts and insights into action; positive, enthusiastic individuals who want to make a difference in the world and are committed to upholding the legacy and tradition of theater in the belief that theater can change a life and make the world a better place for everyone. The interns' primary responsibility is to manage the daily administrative operations of the organization and to take a leadership role in programming initiatives. There will be opportunities to work closely with the senior staff: in administrating over workshops for actors and community programs that serve Youth-at-Risk and homeless children. Under ATW supervision, interns will be accountable for projects in the management of ATW's studio rental business, administration, team management, marketing, development, sales, fund-raising, video production, event planning, and graphic design.

In addition, Interns may also work on a combination of logging, editing, and production of on-going video projects that depend on ATW's current schedule and on the intern's skill level. Interns will work under the direction of a project manager. We seek applicants with training and experience logging footage, editing in Final Cut Pro, http streaming, digital shooting, lighting, sound and web design and development. Interns and Volunteers consistently report they gain tremendously from filming and reviewing footage of ATW classes and workshops and have benefited as if they had actually taken the classes themselves.

BRC gives our clients the knowledge and skills to stay sober and healthy and the sense of responsibility and value to find and maintain a home--in other words, the means to achieve permanent independence. BRC helps these neediest New Yorkers overcome the challenges of addiction, physical and mental illness, and poverty, and improves life in the community. Outreach is BRC's program for homeless individuals living on the streets and in other unstable situations. It is the most extensive outreach program in New York City covering specific Manhattan based locations, i.e. Grand Central Station, Penn Station and Port Authority Bus Terminal, 5 days per week in vans and on foot. Outreach staff and volunteers engages homeless individuals with the goal of assessing each individual's situation and needs and providing each client with an accessible doorway to services they need. Clients are afforded referral, transportation and placement at the resource deemed most beneficial to the individual, and each is treated with respect, professionalism and informed guidance. The Outreach Team encounters many individuals that are reluctant to use services or have found the available resources unmanageable and overwhelming. These clients are provided with counseling, information and advocacy in pursuing services, rights and resources. Every individual engaged is given the opportunity to access the services most suited to their needs. Working with Outreach staff, volunteers will help refer clients to assessment shelters, drop-in centers, drug and alcohol treatment, psychiatric and medical facilities, job training centers and entitlement offices. Normally a staff-only position, volunteers are needed to help us continue in our Outreach efforts. All teams will be midtown Manhattan based specifically at the Port Authority Bus Terminal on either Wednesday of Thursday evenings from 7pm to 9:30pm. This is the perfect opportunity for friends or co-workers who want to get involved together because teams will be comprised of a minimum of three individuals per shift, with a maximum of four each.

Volunteer Kenya / ICODEI is a non-religious, non-political volunteer organization run through a partnership of past overseas volunteers and local Kenyans. Our Microenterprise Development Program is our newest program. We have been active in helping set up small income-generating activities (IGA) for rural self-help groups since the early 2000's (primarily thru grants), but only recently began focusing our work on providing more advice, consulting assistance, and small loans to the groups. MDP volunteers work with the existing microenterprise groups to help them grow and improve their existing projects, as well as help newly forming groups start an IGA. The 5 main areas of volunteer activity in the MDP are as follows: \u2022 Progress Assessment \u2022 Facilitate a Group Project Discussion / Evaluation and Provide Project Advice \u2022 Facilitate Knowledge and Resource Sharing Within the Network of Groups \u2022 Provide Small Loans \u2022 Provide General Business Skills Training Seminars Most volunteers spend their time doing a combination of all the above 5 items. Our value-added is not just in the form of providing financial resources (loans) but includes project planning advice, basic management and accounting training, and (very importantly) volunteers act as facilitators between our vast network of groups in order to facilitate knowledge and resource sharing among the groups. Our pilot microlending program has just gotten off the ground during the last several months and we currently have about $10,000 USD in outstanding loans. The MDP volunteers will be spending a lot of their time over the next several months meeting with the loans groups to ensure that are on schedule with paying back their loans and that they are investing their money prudently (e.g., in productivity enhancing resources versus consumption items). As the loans are repaid, the volunteers then give them out in the form of new loans to other groups. We have a very large backlog of loan application requests. As a volunteer in the MDP you would spend the vast majority of your time out in the field meeting and working with the women microenterprise groups, which is a very rewarding and educational experience. All of the microenterprise groups within our network are independent groups. We do not manage their day to day operations and do not charge any type of fee for our services. We are a strict volunteer non-for-profit organization. All interest that we receive from the microloans goes towards new loans for additional groups. We are now have a network of around 100 microenterprise groups within the western Kenya region. As of June 2007, our organization has had over 350 volunteers since 1998 from over 6 different countries. Volunteers in our Microenterprise Development have come from a variety of backgrounds including undergrad business students (Duke, Rice, Miami, Indiana), MBA and graduate students on their summer break (Stanford, Penn, etc.), management consultants (BCG, McKinsey, CRA), retired professionals, and accountants.

Volunteer Kenya - ICODEI is a non-religious, non-political volunteer organization run through a partnership of past overseas volunteers and local Kenyans. Our Microenterprise Development Program is our newest program. We have been active in helping set up small income-generating activities (IGA) for rural self-help groups since the early 2000's (primarily thru grants), but only recently began focusing our work on providing more advice, consulting assistance, and small loans to the groups. MDP volunteers work with the existing microenterprise groups to help them grow and improve their existing projects, as well as help newly forming groups start an IGA. The 5 main areas of volunteer activity in the MDP are as follows: \u2022 Progress Assessment \u2022 Facilitate a Group Project Discussion / Evaluation and Provide Project Advice \u2022 Facilitate Knowledge and Resource Sharing Within the Network of Groups \u2022 Provide Small Loans \u2022 Provide General Business Skills Training Seminars Most volunteers spend their time doing a combination of all the above 5 items. Our value-added is not just in the form of providing financial resources (loans) but includes project planning advice, basic management and accounting training, and (very importantly) volunteers act as facilitators between our vast network of groups in order to facilitate knowledge and resource sharing among the groups. Our pilot microlending program has just gotten off the ground during the last several months and we currently have about $10,000 USD in outstanding loans. The MDP volunteers will be spending a lot of their time over the next several months meeting with the loans groups to ensure that are on schedule with paying back their loans and that they are investing their money prudently (e.g., in productivity enhancing resources versus consumption items). As the loans are repaid, the volunteers then give them out in the form of new loans to other groups. We have a very large backlog of loan application requests. As a volunteer in the MDP you would spend the vast majority of your time out in the field meeting and working with the women microenterprise groups, which is a very rewarding and educational experience. All of the microenterprise groups within our network are independent groups. We do not manage their day to day operations and do not charge any type of fee for our services. We are a strict volunteer non-for-profit organization. All interest that we receive from the microloans goes towards new loans for additional groups. We are now have a network of around 100 microenterprise groups within the western Kenya region. As of June 2007, our organization has had over 350 volunteers since 1998 from over 6 different countries. Volunteers in our Microenterprise Development have come from a variety of backgrounds including undergrad business students (Duke, Rice, Miami, Indiana), MBA and graduate students on their summer break (Stanford, Penn, etc.), management consultants (BCG, McKinsey, CRA), retired professionals, and accountants.

Sprout is a non-profit organization based in New York City focused on providing innovative programs for adults with developmental disabilities.With our network of resources and dedicated volunteers, which we call leaders, Sprout opens up fascinating new worlds to people with disabilities. Sprout's Overnight Vacations Program is looking for individuals who have the energy, motivation and desire to work with adults with developmental disabilities. What do Sprout leaders do? Sprout leaders' primary goal is to give adults with developmental disabilities the opportunity to experience and enjoy recreational, educational and leisure activities through overnight vacations. Leaders are responsible for the overall safety and enjoyment of their group, 24 hours a day, while on a Sprout trip. Duties include safety monitoring, personal hygiene assistance, providing physical and emotional support, activity planning, budgeting, logistics, and enhancing fun. The work is hard yet immensely rewarding as you develop leadership skills and gain insight into your own abilities. What type of training is provided? Leaders must complete a pre-service training, which provides the necessary procedures and tools to run a successful and enjoyable vacation. Leaders who are drivers receive extra training on how to safely drive our 15-passenger vans. In addition, all leaders receive a copy of Sprout's Leadership Handbook to help with policies and guidelines. What is the time commitment? Sprout vacations last 3 - 7 days depending on the time of year and destination of the trip. When a leader is selected for an overnight vacation, Sprout asks that the leader dedicate themselves to stay with their group throughout the entire duration of the vacation. Some leaders only choose to lead one trip a year while others spend several months with us leading up to 8 trips or more. Sprout strives to make our program flexible for our leaders based on the amount of time leaders can give. Do leaders have any free or personal time while on a trip? Sprout trips are working vacations for the leaders who choose to participate. Because Sprout leaders are responsible for their group 24 hours a day, there is no free or personal time allotted. In order to give our participants the opportunity to experience and enjoy a vacation, Sprout leaders must be available at all times to provide the support any one participant may need. What type of trips can Sprout leaders expect to join? A majority of Sprout trips take place within a day's drive of New York City. Destinations include Atlantic City, Amish Country, Boston, Lake George, Cleveland, Maine and Virginia Beach. Exotic trips like cruises, Hawaii, and Europe are presented to leaders who have demonstrated high levels of commitment, service hours and have gained positive feedback from participants and Sprout office staff. Are there any special skills or requirements? No special background or education is required to become a Sprout leader. We encourage people from all cultures and professions, and of all ethnic and educational backgrounds. Once accepted into the program, you will receive the necessary tools to sign up for outings and how to assist our participants. Requirements include: -21+ years old -Provide references -Participate in training session -Willingness to complete necessary background checks -Evaluate participants' behavior -Fluent English -Willing to drive a 15 passenger van -Love to travel & have fun!

FFL seeks volunteer Board members to help carry out this mission. Fifteen years ago, the Advisory Board of the Bronx Academy of Letters (a new public high school funded with Gates Foundation funds) was formed to provide educational resources and enrichment opportunities to one small school in the Bronx, NY. The vision of the Board was that in urban public schools, where resources were limited, external support for literacy education could provide improved academic performance, increased college readiness and better global citizenship among students. The Board supported and implemented programs at the Bronx Academy of Letters that stressed increased fluency in communication, through immersion with the \\\"word\\\" - written, spoken and performed. After more than a decade of experience serving as the primary external support organization for Bronx Letters, the Advisory Board incorporated in 2012 and formed FFL, which continued its support of Bronx Letters, until August 2014, when it expanded the reach of its work beyond a single school. In 2017, FFL is working to provide urban schools with a blueprint for how to positively impact their communities through external support for literacy-based academic and enrichment programs.

Each week there are hundreds of animal rescue transports taking place where animals are moved from high-kill shelters to no-kill shelters and rescue organizations, as well as foster homes and adopters. It's easy for you to get involved and help save more animals simply by driving a leg in this relay. How it works: 1. Sign-up on Doobert.com or use the Facebook plug-in (search for \\\" Doobert Rescue\\\" on Facebook) and specify the days you're available, the distance you're willing to drive, and then sit back and we'll do the rest. 2. When an animal rescue organization posts a transport request, the system will automatically search to see if it matches your profile (if you're available and within the distance) and then it automatically sends you an e-mail. 3. Then you simply click on the leg that you can cover and everyone else will see that you've signed up for that leg. 4. You'll get communications from the transport coordinator and, once the transport is a \\\"go\\\", you simply drive to the meeting place, load up the animals, and drive them to the next meeting place to hand them off to the next volunteer. You'll get plenty of doggy kisses and thank you's along the way as the animals know you are there to help them.

You get to pick the type, duration and tell potential shelters and rescues about your situation. It&rsquo;s up to you what information you share. 2. We allow approved animal welfare organizations (Shelters and Rescues) to search for volunteers like you, based upon distance and your foster profile. They can see the information you&rsquo;ve shared and reach out to you if there is a match. 3. You&rsquo;ll be contacted by them directly and can determine if you are able to help that particular organization with fostering either overnight, short-term or longer-term.

Graphic Design Internship at ClassWish.org! Work in NYC or Virtually We are recruiting outstanding graphic design students as interns for late Summer 2012 and the 2012-2013 school year (either or both!) to collaborate on the boldest nonprofit initiative we know. We are looking for passionate, energetic students with exceptional skills to create web page layouts, flyers, logos, etc. for ClassWish.org. This is an outstanding leadership opportunity in an innovative start-up nonprofit organization. Here is the problem we are tackling: K-12 schools in this country do not have enough resources to let children explore their potential and excel. Art supplies, books, computers, musical instruments, science equipment, sports equipment, and even paper for computers and printers are all in desperately short supply. Our Approach: ClassWish . org, an exciting new nonprofit, uses modern business practices and the latest marketing techniques to help 125,000 schools serving 56 million kids, inform, inspire and engage supporters. Teachers visit the site to create Wish Lists of the resources they need. People in the community can see exactly what is needed and contribute to help. About Us: The people behind ClassWish.org include such prominent education and business leaders as Adam Hirsch, former COO, Mashable; Laurie Coots, CMO, TBWA; Scott Cutler, EVP, New York Stock Exchange; Betsy Morgan, former CEO, Huffington Post; Nancy Pelz-Paget, Director, Education and Society Program, Aspen Institute; Sharon Robinson, CEO, American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education. Forbes Magazine liked our approach so much that they donated a full page to help raise awareness. Yo-Yo Ma, Tony Hawk and Dwight Howard are among the celebrities who have offered to help promote ClassWish.org. The work: Teachers and students are already getting supplies from ClassWish.org. Now, we need to develop attention-grabbing graphics so we can help more kids. You will take a leadership role and work with other highly motivated interns, established professionals, and directly with our co-founder. What do we offer? You will enhance your portfolio with projects that will be displayed on the Internet as well as in print, visible to potential future employers, and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you have helped children get the tools they need to perform at their best. If you want to gain great experience and do something you will always be proud of, send a cover letter and a resume to interns @ ClassWish . org. Impress us. This is competitive. FAQ Is this a business or a nonprofit? ClassWish is a nonprofit, but we use the latest techniques from the business world to make a leveraged, scalable and financially-self sustaining difference in the lives of tens of millions of children. This sounds ambitious! Daniel Burnham, the great Chicago architect, said \\\"Make no little plans; they have not the power to stir men&rsquo;s souls.\\\" (Nor women&rsquo;s, we hasten to add). Little plans also do not have the power to provide a better education to 56 million kids who deserve more than they are getting today. We face a crushing need in schools, have a solid plan to address it, and with your help, we intend to grow this very large and very fast. Where are you located? We are in Manhattan, conveniently located right across from Madison Square Garden. There are four express subway stops within one block. We will also hire interns to work remotely from other cities. I looked at your site and have some suggestions. Great! This is a collaborative project, and we want to hear from you. Is this a paid internship? We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your portfolio, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions. When will you select the interns? We&rsquo;re agile. When we see a great candidate, we extend an invitation immediately. We won&rsquo;t keep you waiting for a decision. What dates will the internship run? We are hiring for the spring semester, for the summer, and beyond. Tell us what you are looking for. What are the hours? We welcome full-time and part-time interns. Let us know what works for you. What will I need to bring?

Our nonprofit focuses on news about making the world a better place, particularly news related to topics such as global poverty, nonprofits, climate change and human rights. All volunteering is via the computer -- you can be anywhere in the world. The Daily Source is truly a 21st century journalism site. Our online software is incredibly easy to use and automates most of the layout process. Just drag and drop articles from one location to another and the page adjusts itself automatically. Editing the headlines is as easy as using Microsoft Word or sending an e-mail. You will receive guidance from our senior editors who are some of the top newspaper journalists in the U.S. Besides laying out the front page, you will find articles, videos, columns and other material from around the Internet for use on the site and make the final decision of what goes on the site.

You will also gain invaluable experience that will build your skills and look great on a resume. Some of our volunteers have gone on to work in the journalism field. Two of our volunteers started their own non-profit organization after eight months of volunteering with us. One of our editors was hired full-time by Wired.com and another was hired by Congress as the official congressional photographer of senators at public events. We have an extensive training process that is about a month long, so if we are going to train you, we need you to do a certain amount of hours in all to make it worth the time we put into it. Therefore, the Front Page Editor role is a minimum of 15 hours per week for a minimum of six months. If you can volunteer 20 hours or higher a week, then the minimum is only five months, or you can do 12 hours a week for seven and a half months. We tend to give preference to applicants who can do a sizable number of hours. All editors are credited at the bottom of the site each day, and daily editions are archived so your friends, family and future employers will see what you were part of creating.

All these positions are telecommute so you don&rsquo;t have to drive or dress up, and can work from the comfort of your home. You might also be able to use our local Internet location, though there is some cost for that so virtual is preferred. If you apply for a position, you should view your commitment to it the same as if it were a paid position. We treat volunteers like normal staff and rely on them like staff. Our site is 99% volunteer run and we all depend on each other to make it a success. Please do not apply if you are viewing this opportunity as \\\"just a volunteer position\\\" and would treat it as less important than paid positions or other commitments you have. If you are in school, volunteering with us can function as an internship. Interns can usually receive credit with their school for their internships. Content Editor (10 hours a week for a minimum of 6 months): Searches the Internet for high quality articles, columns, editorials and videos, adds them to our system, and ranks them by quality. The front page editors pick from these to publish on the front page. Also does research and fact-checking when needed. This requires Internet surfing skills, strong understanding and judgment of the news, and attention to detail. Marketing and Social Media (6 hours a week for a minimum of 5 months): Help research potential media outlets and blogs to cover our site, e-mail our press releases to them, and keep track of coverage of our site that has occurred. We have a great website and need to get the word out about it.
