Each week, you will meet one-on-one with your student every week to help them develop strong literacy skills and discover a passion for reading. We'll provide a structured curriculum, in-person training, and ongoing support to help your student thrive. Rigorous research has proven that Reading Partners significantly increases reading proficiency. No teaching experience required and anyone over the age of 14 can volunteer. Flexible Monday to Thursday volunteer times between 9am and 5pm.

We are a \\\"co-locator\\\" to HeartShare Saint Vincent's Services under Cornerstone at Wyckoff Gardens Community Center, a New York City Housing Authority location. All tutors are fingerprinted at the expense of HeartShare and all tutors provide medical clearance including TB test at their own expense. Medical and TB test need to be updated by the tutor annually. References, resumee, criminal records check and various other paperwork are also required. Each new volunteer tutor is interviewed to determine his or her areas of academic strength and interest. The Tutoring Coordinator, Steven Shooman, then matches the strengths, motivations, and availability of the potential tutors with the needs and personalities of the students who have applied. Most tutors meet their students once a week, with sessions lasting one hour. This usually occurs during after school hours, that is Monday through Friday from 3:00 to 6:00. The tutor, student, and parent/guardian are encouraged to contact the Tutoring Coordinator if they have any problems or concerns they cannot resolve.

Sprout is a non-profit organization based in New York City focused on providing innovative programs for adults with developmental disabilities.With our network of resources and dedicated volunteers, which we call leaders, Sprout opens up fascinating new worlds to people with disabilities. Sprout's Overnight Vacations Program is looking for individuals who have the energy, motivation and desire to work with adults with developmental disabilities. What do Sprout leaders do? Sprout leaders' primary goal is to give adults with developmental disabilities the opportunity to experience and enjoy recreational, educational and leisure activities through overnight vacations. Leaders are responsible for the overall safety and enjoyment of their group, 24 hours a day, while on a Sprout trip. Duties include safety monitoring, personal hygiene assistance, providing physical and emotional support, activity planning, budgeting, logistics, and enhancing fun. The work is hard yet immensely rewarding as you develop leadership skills and gain insight into your own abilities. What type of training is provided? Leaders must complete a pre-service training, which provides the necessary procedures and tools to run a successful and enjoyable vacation. Leaders who are drivers receive extra training on how to safely drive our 15-passenger vans. In addition, all leaders receive a copy of Sprout's Leadership Handbook to help with policies and guidelines. What is the time commitment? Sprout vacations last 3 - 7 days depending on the time of year and destination of the trip. When a leader is selected for an overnight vacation, Sprout asks that the leader dedicate themselves to stay with their group throughout the entire duration of the vacation. Some leaders only choose to lead one trip a year while others spend several months with us leading up to 8 trips or more. Sprout strives to make our program flexible for our leaders based on the amount of time leaders can give. Do leaders have any free or personal time while on a trip? Sprout trips are working vacations for the leaders who choose to participate. Because Sprout leaders are responsible for their group 24 hours a day, there is no free or personal time allotted. In order to give our participants the opportunity to experience and enjoy a vacation, Sprout leaders must be available at all times to provide the support any one participant may need. What type of trips can Sprout leaders expect to join? A majority of Sprout trips take place within a day's drive of New York City. Destinations include Atlantic City, Amish Country, Boston, Lake George, Cleveland, Maine and Virginia Beach. Exotic trips like cruises, Hawaii, and Europe are presented to leaders who have demonstrated high levels of commitment, service hours and have gained positive feedback from participants and Sprout office staff. Are there any special skills or requirements? No special background or education is required to become a Sprout leader. We encourage people from all cultures and professions, and of all ethnic and educational backgrounds. Once accepted into the program, you will receive the necessary tools to sign up for outings and how to assist our participants. Requirements include: -21+ years old -Provide references -Participate in training session -Willingness to complete necessary background checks -Evaluate participants' behavior -Fluent English -Willing to drive a 15 passenger van -Love to travel & have fun!

Sprout's NYC Program provides evening and weekend recreational activities for highly-social adults with mild-to-moderate developmental disabilities. These activities are all over the five boroughs of New York City and include sporting events, museums, art classes, festivals, dinners and more! Sprout Leaders provide supervision to our groups for 2-6 hour long excursions while encouraging positive socialization and having fun with them. Leaders also assist with some logistical elements of activities such as handling a small budget or directing a participant to the nearest subway station. Each month, Leaders are sent a calendar of events and can choose the activities they would like to lead.

You'll get communications from the transport coordinator and, once the transport is a \\\"go\\\", you simply drive to the meeting place, load up the animals, and drive them to the next meeting place to hand them off to the next volunteer.

Grace Healthcare Services is a Community-based Hospice program that cares for Veterans at the end of life. Volunteers are an essential component of this care. WHY A NEED FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS? -Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect to patients who have served our country. -Veterans share a common bond and code of conduct. -The camaraderie that exists between Veterans has proven to be a great support for the Veterans we care for. As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee. If you are interested or have questions please contact the Grace Healthcare Services Volunteer Department at 732-225-4100 and ask for Ms. Moynihan to inquire about the Veteran-to-Veteran Volunteer Program.

This initiative will place a focus on planning for death with the elderly patient and family if there is one, and will provide a continuous around the clock vigil as death becomes imminent. The program will help the elderly patient who lacks family or adequate caregiver support to die comfortably, without fear of being alone. Even when surrounded by loved ones, individuals with a terminal illness and those closest to them may feel isolated as they face the end of life. As the end of life approaches, patients and families struggle with anxiety and fear; exhaustion; loved ones often feel alone, unprepared and afraid; and opportunities to explore meaning go unaddressed. Hospice Doulas provide emotional support and comfort to patients and their loved ones in the final phase of a terminal illness. Our End-of-Life (EOL) Doula volunteers will receive thorough training in understanding the dying process and in the skills that help bring peace and comfort to all involved. This free two-day training includes learning how to do guided visualization, help create rituals, provide simple physical support, offer sacred presence, as well as how to create spiritual and emotional legacies. Parker Jewish institute will be hosting a free two-day Doula training workshop on Saturday 10/28/17 and Sunday 10/29/17 from 9:00am-6:00pm. Breakfast and lunch will be served. A certificate will be awarded upon completion of this workshop. If you are interested in attending, please call the Hospice Program's Volunteer Doula Coordinator at 718-289-2134, or email volunteer-nerken@parkerinstitute.org. Doulas can come from any background and no experience is required. They typically work in as part of a team. They usually sit quietly with a patient, talk with them and offer support, comfort and companionship.

Hospice volunteers are a special group of people that use their time and talents to enrich the quality of life for our patients and their families as the end of life approaches. Hospice volunteers enhance the quality of life and help reduce the burden for family caregivers by providing support, assistance, in patient&rsquo;s homes, in nursing homes, and assisted living facilities. To be a volunteer, there is no special requirement other than a sincere desire to help people and the ability to listen. The most important thing you can do is be there for patients to reassure them they are not alone. It is not an easy undertaking, but it can enrich your life well as patients and families. Hospice volunteers can commit to as little or as much time as they wish. Some volunteers provide several hours of service each week while others commit to a few hours each month. Serving as valued members of the hospice team, for just a few hours of your time you can make a significant impact on the lives of patients and their loved ones. There are many opportunities to share your time and talents as a volunteer and support patients, their loved ones dealing with end of life. Opportunities include: Hospice Doulas Bereavement/Grief Patient Friendly Visits Legacy Projects Administrative Support Community Education Help Recruiting Other Volunteers Note: We ask that those who have recently lost a loved one wait a year before becoming a hospice volunteer. You are welcome to participate in our bereavement programs during this time. All hospice volunteers receive extensive training.

As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee. If you are interested or have questions please contact the Grace Healthcare Services Volunteer Department at 732-225-4100 and ask for Ms. Moynihan to inquire about the Veteran-to-Veteran Volunteer Program.

Whether the Music Volunteer is sharing an existing musical skill or playing music via the radio or digital device, the goal is to enhance the quality of life of our patients. Often, regularly scheduled visits are requested, however Music Volunteers may also be asked to provide musical visits on an occasional basis for one patient/family or for a group of patients at a facility as outreach for the local hospice agency. Hospice is built on the philosophy that we care for our patients in mind, body and soul. Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, memory bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network. They often make phone calls to check up on family members and also send cards of comfort and care.

Project Coordinators (or PCs) provide leadership in Jersey Cares&rsquo; recurring volunteer opportunities by serving as a liaison between volunteers, nonprofit partners, and Jersey Cares. They encourage volunteers to \\\"Be the Change\\\" and provide directions during projects. It&rsquo;s a fun learning opportunity where you get to network with nonprofits and other community leaders while being supported by a cohort of other volunteer leaders.

Instead of 6 months, Seasons of Service Project Coordinators take on 10 weeks (though you may certainly continue as a Project Coordinator after that time), and have a chance to work more intimately with their peers; discussions and team-building are encouraged during Seasons of Service.

We think we have an innovative solution to helping students achieve so they can have an equal shot at these schools - including competitive schools like LaGuardia High School of Performing Arts or Midwood or Murrow or any other school recognized as top by the most competitive colleges. That's you! Help us create a new pathway for students! Empower real change. Volunteers are asked to commit at least two hours a week - probably weekends - for at least one month, but preferably for three months or years to work with a student on special skills. You must: sign that commitment when you finish your term, explain to the next tutor what you are working on with the student confer with our certified educators for guidance so you know exactly what they need to work on. STUDENTS - WE CAN GIVE COMMUNITY SERVICE HOURS FOR THIS. Locations? May vary - it might be Brooklyn Central Library near Grand Army Plaza or a school in Brownsville, Flatbush or Crown Heights, Brooklyn or maybe right at Stuyvesant High School or one of the top high schools. If you have a location near a train, let us know. Who are the students you will tutor? Each student must write a letter or essay, saying why he or she wants to go to a top high school and signing, with a parent, their commitment to coming every week for as long as it takes. We are starting at 3rd or 4th grade, and offer this to students through 8th grade. We hope to launch this on MLK weekend 2018 - so respond right away. PS - We would like to ask every volunteer to donate $50 or anything to help support our efforts. If you just want to tutor and cannot give, that is okay. But this is an unfunded program, so we are asking for donations to pay the people who are creating and organizing these opportunities and to administer this. All donations are tax-deductible. If you are willing to fundraise at all - even a bake sale - for our efforts, we would truly appreciate. Our goal is $20,000 and we want to offer tutors to as many children who want it - can be 100 or more... you can see what we do at seedsinthemiddle.org and on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/seedsinthemiddle/ What is our goal?

Whether the Music Volunteer is sharing an existing musical skill or playing music via the radio or digital device, the goal is to enhance the quality of life of our patients. Often, regularly scheduled visits are requested, however Music Volunteers may also be asked to provide musical visits on an occasional basis for one patient/family or for a group of patients at a facility as outreach for the local hospice agency. Hospice is built on the philosophy that we care for our patients in mind, body and soul. Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, memory bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network. They often make phone calls to check up on family members and also send cards of comfort and care.

Puppy walkers help Foundation puppies grow up to be confident dogs. What's involved in raising a Guide Dog Foundation puppy? Bosley went to live with his puppy walkers when he was about nine weeks old. He's learning basic obedience and social skills while being exposed to many different situations. People who raise Guide Dog Foundation puppies say it is the most rewarding thing they've ever done. Puppy raisers come from everywhere - stay-at-home moms or dads, teachers, college students, retirees, people with flexible work environments - and are crucial members of the Guide Dog Foundation family. By opening their hearts and homes to a puppy, a puppy raiser plays a crucial role in helping a person with disabilities live an independent life. Every puppy walker family works with a Guide Dog Foundation puppy adviser, who is available to answer questions and offer guidance and support. When he is about 14 months old, Bosley will return to the Guide Dog Foundation's Smithtown campus to begin his training as a guide or service dog.

Volunteer Opportunities: Companionship Volunteers work directly with patients providing companionship, offering friendly visits, reading to patients, writing letters, offering a gentle touch or sharing a quiet moment. Complementary Volunteers are certified/trained professionals who can provide complementary modalities of reflexology, music, imagery and touch therapies such as Reiki, massage, therapeutic touch and healing hands. Pet Therapy Volunteers provide certified/trained pets who visit with patients. These animals provide loving memories for some and give unconditional love helping our patients feel connected to a larger world. Administrative Volunteers provide help to the staff in our Edison office by assisting with typing, addressing cards, organizing newsletters, creating packets, collating manuals and other varied clerical duties Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, huggable dolls/bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Junior Volunteers consist of groups such as girl/boy scouts or young people who wish to honor our patients by making holiday cards, posters, wall hangings and memory books. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families and friends of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network. Hospice training classes are required for Companionship and Complementary Volunteers. They are free of charge and offered on an ongoing basis. Grace Healthcare Services serves counties throughout New Jersey. Areas where you are needed include: Atlantic County, Bergen County, Cape May County, Essex County, Hudson County, Mercer County, Middlesex County, Monmouth County, Morris County, North Passaic County, Ocean County, Somerset County, South Passaic County, Burlington County, Camden County and Union County.

The instructor uses pre-approved lesson plans and activities to help students become informed about the links between poverty and illiteracy while also teaching students the importance of planning in life with a segway into the importance of proper lesson planning for a literacy program. Students are challenged to break into teams, select from a group of random items and create their own lesson plans for a specific age group. The following week, each team visits a local shelter partnered with our organization and they host a 1-hour literacy program with the children in the shelter program. The program finishes off with a lesson in identifying literacy challenges in our own communities among our peers and is followed up with a subsequent literacy day for the community. The literacy day is planned by the students and all games are created or reinvented by the students. They invite their collective communities, family, and friends out to the event where students are awarded and recognized for their work. Lesson plans, activities, and supplies are provided to the instructor. The group will meet on Thursdays April-May. One Wednesday evening (6:30pm-7:30pm) is also required for the visit with homeless youth. The Literacy day event will be held on Saturday, May 19th from approximately 12pm-3pm.

Duties: Volunteer Advocates conduct thorough research on the background of the case, reviewing documents and interviewing all parties involved. They report to the court, raising issues of concern that may interfere with a child's best interests and providing information that will help the judge make an informed decision. Volunteer Advocates can also play a pivotal role in assuring that a child or family is receiving services the court has ordered, such as physical or mental health services, substance abuse counseling or special education. During the life of a case, Volunteer Advocates monitor the child's situation to assure he or she remains safe and may be the only constant in the child's life as he or she moves through the bureaucratic maze of the child welfare system. Volunteers come from all backgrounds and need not have experience in legal or social services. The only requirement is a strong desire to help children who are in dire need of help.

Guiding Principles As a board member, I understand that I owe duties of care, loyalty, and obedience to the organization and the children it serves. The duty of care is the duty to monitor Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s activities, see that its mission is being accomplished, and guard its financial resources. The duty of loyalty is the duty to avoid conflicts of interest. The duty of obedience is to be faithful to Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s mission and to comply with the law. I will uphold these duties and do my utmost to ensure that Maya&rsquo;s Hope performs its mission and achieves its goals. Principal Commitments Act with integrity and represent the interests of all people served by the organization. Recognize that decisions of the board can be made only by a majority vote at a) a board meeting or b) in writing. Respect the majority decisions of the board. Participate in: Board self-evaluation programs. Board development workshops, seminars, and other educational events that enhance skills as a board member. Handle information with discretion and confidentiality as necessary. Exercise authority as a board member only when acting in a meeting with the full board or as delegated by the board with members. Collaborate with members who serve this board and leave personal prejudices out of all board discussions. Represent Maya&rsquo;s Hope in a positive and supportive manner at all times. Display courteous conduct at all board and committee meetings. Refrain from intruding on administrative issues that are the responsibility of management, except to monitor the results of the organization. Monitor the financial condition of the organization. Understand and comply with the bylaws of Maya&rsquo;s Hope. Avoid conflicts of interest between my position as a board member and my personal or professional life (as referenced in Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s Conflict of Interest Policy.) If such a conflict does arise, I will disclose that conflict to the board and refrain from voting on matters in which I have conflict. Liability of Board Members As a fully incorporated non-profit, Maya&rsquo;s Hope enjoys the same limited liability that any corporation does. Corporations offer the protection of limited liability to corporate directors and officers. Limited liability means that the organization's directors and officers have limited personal liability for business debts. Generally, creditors can only go after corporate assets and insurance to satisfy liabilities incurred by the corporation. This principle applies, however, only when the board has fulfilled its basic duties, such as the duty of care. A board member is legally bound to exercise reasonable care when he or she makes a decision for the organization. Reasonable care is what an 'ordinarily prudent' person in a similar situation would do. Examples of when a board member may have personal liability include (but are not limited to) when a board member: personally and directly injures someone. personally guarantees a bank loan or a business debt on which the corporation defaults, or behaves in a fraudulent or illegal manner that causes harm, Maya&rsquo;s Hope maintains a Directors & Officers liability insurance policy. Responsibilities of Secretary: Meeting Minutes The primary task of the secretary of an executive board is to record and maintain the minutes of each board meeting. Meeting minutes are detail reports that highlight the predetermined agenda of each conference as well as what actually took place. For example, a secretary may notate the following: \\\"The meeting began at 11 a.m. The first order of business was for the president to discuss potential changes to the organization&rsquo;s mission statement; however, he was unable to attend the gathering due to medical reasons. The issue was put on hold until a later date.\\\" Record Maintenance As the custodian of corporate records, the secretary of an executive board must maintain all company files in a manner compliant with organizational policies as well as any laws that regulate the industry. These documents may include the firm&rsquo;s article of incorporation, bylaws and employee contact lists, as well as financial records. He must also develop and enforce policies regarding access to these confidential files. Security controls, such as who can access which files and what approvals are needed to do so, are examples of the many procedures he must implement. Depending on the industry in which the company does business, the secretary of the executive board may be required to file certain documents with the government. For example, a nonprofit organization must meet certain criteria to maintain its tax-exempt status. It is often the responsibility of the secretary to ensure that all necessary paperwork is completed and returned to the Internal Revenue Service. Organizational Representative It is not uncommon for the secretary of an executive board to serve as its signing officer. This designation gives her the authority to sign documents, such as contracts, checks and credit applications, on behalf of the organization. Because this responsibility wields so much power, many firms implement a system of checks and balances so it is not abused. For instance, before signing a service agreement, the secretary may need the express written permission of two other board members. She must follow these guidelines or risk termination and, in severe cases, criminal prosecution.", "title": "Board Member Opening at Maya's Hope", "zipcode": "10001", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D2862432%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "Maya's Hope"}, {"end": null, "description": "Marketing & Communications Director Tasks involved in position Lead the Marketing and Communications Chair to direct the overall comprehensive marketing and communications strategy.

While a million nonprofits desperately need more funds to accomplish their missions, Americans spend $450 billion a year on birthday, holiday, and other presents. Most of those presents are not very rewarding. Tons of sweaters, fuzzy slippers, and ties end up in the dark corners of our closets. It is no surprise that a growing number of people, who seek meaning more than \\\"stuff,\\\" are starting to show their love by donating in a friend&rsquo;s name in lieu of giving traditional presents. The challenge for nonprofits is that it is simply too daunting to provide the requisite gift-like experience (tangible charitable gifts, wish lists and registries, and personalized printed greeting cards) that can make a donation feel like a rewarding gift. ChangingThePresent.org provides those tools to facilitate this type of giving for nonprofits and donors. We are about to take ChangingThePresent to the next level. That involves expanding from the initial 400 organizations to inviting all 1.1 million nonprofits, as well as adding additional causes and categories. Within each cause area, we will seek growth funding, invite advisors, recruit nonprofits, use media and social media to raise awareness among the public, and recruit celebrities to lend their voices. Imagine the impact we can make together as more and more people adopt this type of meaningful gift-giving! Casual and Friendly Office Environment This is a great place to work.

The Problem We Address The skyrocketing cost of college textbooks undermines the education and lives of millions of students, who spend an average of $1,300 a year on books and supplies. 70% of them cannot afford books for all their classes. 30% of them are unable to take classes they want, simply because the books are too expensive. Tacked onto student loans, the textbook costs can haunt them for years. We Are Going to Change the Situation Colleges and universities could greatly decrease the cost of textbooks by adopting ten measures, described in the petition below. We are leading a movement to encourage students, faculty, recent graduates, high school students, and parents to advocate for these changes. The Petition Colleges and universities could save students billions of dollars a year on textbooks by adopting these policies. We call on them to: Consider the cost when selecting textbooks. Use free Open Source textbooks whenever possible. Do not require university-specific editions or (unless essential) the latest edition, which undermine the used book market. Refrain from requiring students to purchase expensive access codes for homework assignments and quizzes. Tell students what textbooks are required and what they cost before registration begins so they have time to shop for savings. Have college bookstores transparently serve students, rather than profit off of them. Inform students of scholarships to fund textbooks. Have college libraries put enough textbooks on reserve for in-house use. Support book exchanges for students to trade used books. Establish a standing student-faculty committee dedicated to this issue. A Nonprofit Movement Free The Textbooks is a nonprofit movement.

A pioneering nonprofit, Heifer International, has shown that nonprofits can capture some of that money by making donations, given in a friend&rsquo;s name, feel like a present. It works! They raise $115 million a year this way. Imagine how much more gift money could be captured by nonprofits addressing popular causes, including your favorites. The challenge is that it is too daunting for most nonprofits to provide a gift-like experience: tangible donation opportunities, wish lists, gift registries, and personalized printed greeting cards. About www.ChangingThePresent.org Our nonprofit site provides a gift-like experience, which helps 400 leading nonprofits capture money normally spent on traditional presents. The NY Times called it an \\\"amazon.com of the nonprofit world.\\\" We are now about to invite all million nonprofits to join the site. We are also providing each with their own private, charitable gift sites so they can send supporters without exposing them to other nonprofits. See a sample: http://SampleNGO.GiftsForHumanity.org.

We offer four great benefits: Take on a leadership role Enhance your resume Make a difference Generate funds for college tuition and textbooks We are looking for passionate, energetic students with exceptional skills. This is an outstanding leadership opportunity in an innovative start-up nonprofit organization. About ClassWish ClassWish is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in NYC and working nationwide. Our initial focus was in providing resources for K-12 students. We are now turning attention to help generate funds for nonprofits and for college tuition and textbooks, as well. We offer high-achieving students unparalleled opportunities to assume responsibility, use their skills, gain experience, and make a difference--and provide relief from the cost of college tuition and textbooks. Here are the problems we are tackling: We are tackling two problems at once: Nonprofits need far more funding to fulfill their missions, and schools need far more resources for kids (books, computers, art supplies, musical instruments, science equipment, and sports equipment are all in desperately short supply). Students and their families are burdened by the skyrocketing cost of college tuition and textbooks. (By the way, be sure to see www.TuitionRevolution.org). Our Approach ClassWish is launching a new initiative to address these needs. Soon, students and their families will be able to earn an average of 8% of what they spend at stores, grocers, gas stations, restaurants, hotels, and airlines, and they will be able to direct that to their favorite schools, teachers, nonprofits, or even their own tuition and textbooks. What Campus Reps Will Do ClassWish Campus Reps will help raise awareness of this opportunity for students, professors, and their families to generate funding for schools, nonprofits, and college tuition. We will recruit a campus rep on each college campus. They, in turn, will recruit additional campus reps to focus on each of these areas: Greek life Residence halls Athletics Student government Student clubs and organizations Professors and administration Alumni Student media Social media Events Graphics Communications Marketing We Want to Hear From Outstanding Students Interested in becoming a Campus Rep?

Our Approach: ClassWish . org, an exciting nonprofit, uses modern business practices and the latest marketing techniques to help generate funding to provide needed resources to 56 million kids at 125,000 schools.

Now, we need to raise greater awareness and funding so we can encourage more participation and help more kids. The fashion industry is a key element of that. We are engaging with the Fashion industry, as follows: We will invite famous fashion designers to participate in the celebrity section of ClassWish. They will get their own page, where they can lend their voice to providing children with art suppleis and other resources; honor their own favorite teacher; and link to other fashion icons who are doing the same. They will also appear on web banner ads that we design specifically for each of them. We will secure donated ad inventory from fashion magazines, websites, blogs, schools, and retailers. The ClassWish PSA ads will feature the celebrities involved in the program. We will build Cause Marketing and promotional campaigns with fashion brands and retailers. For instance, we are working on one campaign now: 'Win a wardrobe for yourself and one for your favorite teacher.&rsquo; We will seek editorial coverage of the campaign from fashion magazines and websites. We will use social media to reinforce these campaigns. We are a small organization, so we seek outstanding students who can take a leadership role. They will work in small teams and with our co-founder and other professionals. The fashion program is a new one for us, so this is a ground-floor opportunity.

Little plans also do not have the power to provide a better education to 56 million kids who deserve more than they are getting today. We face a crushing need in schools, have a solid plan to address it, and with your help, we intend to grow this very large and very fast. Where are you located? We are in Manhattan, conveniently located right across from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. Four express subway stops, LIRR, and the PATH train are all within one block. We will also hire interns to work remotely from other cities (but for other roles, not bookkeeping). What skills and experience are you looking for? This posting is for a bookkeeping intern. We also seek interns with a wide range of skills: graphic designers, videographers, writers, researchers, creative thinkers, analytical sorts, community organizers, social media stars, people with great communication skills, MBA students, and more. I looked at your site and have some suggestions. Great! This is a collaborative project, and we want to hear from you. Your ClassWish review will be helpful. Is this a paid internship? We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your rsum, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions. Do check to see if your school offers a stipend program. When will you select the interns? We&rsquo;re agile. When we see a great candidate, we extend an invitation immediately. We won&rsquo;t keep you waiting for a decision. What dates will the internship run? We are flexible. Tell us what you are looking for. What are the hours? We welcome full-time and part-time interns. Let us know what works for you. What will I need to bring? Brains, heart, passion, energy, a notebook computer (as an early-stage nonprofit, we just can&rsquo;t afford to buy dozens of machines), and a passion to make an immediate improvement to the education of tens of millions of children.

Be a Campus Rep for ClassWish.org! We are recruiting outstanding undergraduate and graduate students as Campus Reps to collaborate on the boldest nonprofit initiative we know. We are looking for entrepreneurial, passionate, and energetic students with exceptional skills. This is an outstanding leadership opportunity in an innovative start-up nonprofit. Here is the problem we are tackling: K-12 schools in this country do not have enough resources to let children explore their potential and excel. Books, computers, art supplies, musical instruments, science equipment, sports equipment, and even paper for computers and printers are all in desperately short supply. Our Approach: ClassWish . org, an exciting new nonprofit, uses modern business practices and the latest marketing techniques to help 125,000 schools serving 56 million kids, inform, inspire and engage supporters. Teachers visit the site to create Wish Lists of the resources they need. People in the community can see exactly what is needed and contribute to help. About Us: The people behind ClassWish.org include such prominent education and business leaders as Adam Hirsch, former COO, Mashable; Laurie Coots, CMO, TBWA; Scott Cutler, EVP, New York Stock Exchange; Betsy Morgan, former CEO, Huffington Post; Nancy Pelz-Paget, Director, Education and Society Program, Aspen Institute; Sharon Robinson, CEO, American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education. Forbes Magazine liked our approach so much that they donated a full page to help raise awareness. Yo-Yo Ma, Tony Hawk and Dwight Howard are among the celebrities who have offered to help promote ClassWish.org. Most importantly, current and former interns will offer a great review of ClassWish.org. The work: Teachers and students are already getting supplies from ClassWish.org. Now, we need to raise greater awareness and encourage more participation so we can help more kids. Campus Reps will promote various campaigns at their colleges. The first to launch is a micro-philanthropy program, which you can read about at http://ThankTheTeachers.org. College students are writing notes to former K-12 teachers to thank them for their support and to let them know of ClassWish.org, at the same time. This is a great way for teachers to learn of the opportunity to get needed resources, and it is a quick and easy way for college students to make a difference. Imagine how many teachers we could reach if even 25% of the students at your college each took just a couple of minutes to write to former teachers. Campus Reps will promote Thank The Teachers on their campus, using a combination of direct outreach, social media, and other communications tools. What do we offer? You will enhance your resume with a solid record of professional achievement and community service, and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you have helped children get the tools they need to perform at their best.

RSVP for our Information Session for Video Professionals! (See RSVP details below!) Our goal is to put together a volunteer team that can edit the groundbreaking work being done at The Actors Theatre Workshop. Using your professional skills to edit this wonderful material will surely stimulate hope, excitement and I believe bring true enlightenment to those who participate. At the same time you will reach another dimension in your craft as you learn about the unique filming/editing perspective of the ATW Founder and Artistic Director, Thurman E. Scott. ATW has long been on the front lines of disciplined creative training for theater professionals and individuals committed to fulfilling their creative potential. ATW has also been a safe haven for thousands of at-risk and homeless youth. The original theater and educational technique which has been tremendously successful with our professional acting students, has proven to be equally beneficial to the children we teach in our after-school programs. We have many years of footage from our adult acting workshop's and community program's that we want to share with you and the world. We've started sharing this video online and we've received such positive feedback from every corner of the globe that we are taking steps to put out more. This process takes time and so we would like to find more dedicated individuals who want to learn and make a difference in other people's lives and be a part of something hopeful by joining our video editing team. Our editors often talk about the beautiful, inspiring and deeply moving moments they have witnessed when a student actor or a child from a homeless shelter brings forth his talent and reaches for their potential. You literally see the moments when there is a shift in consciousness and they begin to accept their strength and the unique gifts that they have to offer the world. And in that moment you know that this person has changed forever-- and as a result undoubtedly so have you. By working directly with this material you will gain deep insight into the emotional and psychological breakdown of drama, and learn to see the penetrating insights that come out of script analysis, which gives you the ability to find and understand the eternal essence of ideas that are then formulated into a universal idea that helps to instill faith and spread hope to all individuals on a creative journey. So without further ado.. We invite you to a Volunteer Info Session for video editing professionals .To RSVP go to: http://www.actorstheatreworkshop.com, click on \\\"volunteers\\\" and fill out an online application.

This is an intensive Leadership Training Program in non-profit business management. Interns receive hands-on training as a management assistant. If skilled in video, interns may assist in video production and editing at our award-winning theater arts and community service organization. As video production becomes increasingly critical to the growth, development and success of managing a successful non-profit, we seek intern candidates that are leaders who are passionate about non-profit management and posses skills in video production and editing. Successful non-profits are built on powerful ideas that inspire hope. These ideas are manifested in the programs and the management of the organization. By gaining a working understanding of how to successfully manage a nonprofit organization, the intern begins to learn its core principals, which allows the intern to begin to take a leadership role in the organization. In addition, this knowledge is invaluable in the creation of videos that effectively promote and bring this work to the world. These videos are essential to the marketing and fund-raising efforts in any successful non-profit. We are looking for individuals with the ability to lead, manage teams, work independently, communicate effectively on the phone, in person and in writing and interact in a fast-paced business environment. We are looking for idealists and leaders who can put their thoughts and insights into action; positive, enthusiastic individuals who want to make a difference in the world and are committed to upholding the legacy and tradition of theater in the belief that theater can change a life and make the world a better place for everyone. The interns' primary responsibility is to manage the daily administrative operations of the organization and to take a leadership role in programming initiatives. There will be opportunities to work closely with the senior staff: in administrating over workshops for actors and community programs that serve Youth-at-Risk and homeless children. Under ATW supervision, interns will be accountable for projects in the management of ATW's studio rental business, administration, team management, marketing, development, sales, fund-raising, video production, event planning, and graphic design. For international applicants, English proficiency is required. In addition, Interns may also work on a combination of logging, editing, and production of on-going video projects that depend on ATW's current schedule and on the intern's skill level. Interns will work under the direction of a project manager. We seek applicants with training and experience logging footage, editing in Final Cut Pro, http streaming, digital shooting, lighting, sound and web design and development. Interns and Volunteers consistently report they gain tremendously from filming and reviewing footage of ATW classes and workshops and have benefited as if they had actually taken the classes themselves. In summary, we seek professional, detail-oriented individuals who are positive and curious, with a desire to learn and engage in a process. The Actors Theatre Workshop is an award-winning non-profit theater, educational institution and community center in NYC founded by award-winning actor, director, writer and producer, Thurman E.

BRC helps these neediest New Yorkers overcome the challenges of addiction, physical and mental illness, and poverty, and improves life in the community. Outreach is BRC's program for homeless individuals living on the streets and in other unstable situations. It is the most extensive outreach program in New York City covering specific Manhattan based locations, i.e. Grand Central Station, Penn Station and Port Authority Bus Terminal, 5 days per week in vans and on foot. Outreach staff and volunteers engages homeless individuals with the goal of assessing each individual's situation and needs and providing each client with an accessible doorway to services they need. Clients are afforded referral, transportation and placement at the resource deemed most beneficial to the individual, and each is treated with respect, professionalism and informed guidance. The Outreach Team encounters many individuals that are reluctant to use services or have found the available resources unmanageable and overwhelming. These clients are provided with counseling, information and advocacy in pursuing services, rights and resources. Every individual engaged is given the opportunity to access the services most suited to their needs. Working with Outreach staff, volunteers will help refer clients to assessment shelters, drop-in centers, drug and alcohol treatment, psychiatric and medical facilities, job training centers and entitlement offices.

A strong social justice-centered curriculum and required readings will form the core framework for the internship. At the end of the summer, interns will have completed a portfolio with work from daily classroom and professional development sessions, co-led a professional development session, gained leadership skills, and developed a culminating Hustle project that they will showcase for other GO Project interns, staff members, board members, and community supporters.

CBSBB&rsquo;s target populations are children from first generation, low-income communities. Many of the families we work with are overwhelmed by multiple stressors. Poverty, a shortage of skills and a lack of exposure to opportunities are some of the issues our mentees face every day. These children are eager to expand their horizons and having a mentor can be the difference between their current reality and a successful future. You can be that difference!

Often, regularly scheduled visits are requested, however Music Volunteers may also be asked to provide musical visits on an occasional basis for one patient/family or for a group of patients at a facility as outreach for the local hospice agency. Hospice is built on the philosophy that we care for our patients in mind, body and soul. Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, memory bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network. They often make phone calls to check up on family members and also send cards of comfort and care.

In 1998, the Children&rsquo;s Defense Fund reported that violent crime by young people ages 10-17 peaks between 3 and 7 PM; children and teens in poor neighborhoods are struggling for direction and positive opportunities are needed to keep them safe and on-track; a great majority of all American fourth graders cannot read or do math at grade level, including more than five of six black children. In addition, a study published in Pediatrics magazine found that eighth graders who were left alone after school reported greater use of cigarettes, marijuana, and alcohol than those in adult-supervised settings. Current research indicates that supervised after-school and summer programs not only keep children safe and out of trouble, they also significantly improve their academic achievement. PROJECT DESCRIPTION Teaching high-risk, inner-city Youth the skills to become successful in life is at the core of the ACN SUMMER YOUTH CAPACITY BUILDING program. The Four(4) major components of the program are: *Homework Assistance through tutoring, mentoring and Use of Computer labs. *Nutrition Education to promote healthy lifestyles and Combat Obesity. *Life Skills which are integrated throughout all phases of the program. *Soccer Instructions where participants engage in fun physical fitness, enjoy the camaraderie of playing in a soccer team format with friends and peers, and learn to become responsible adolescents and adults. The summer After-School Program- will serve approximately 600 children which includes academic tutoring five(5) hours per week and Soccer Instruction, Health and life skills education ten(10) hours per week. Participants will receive Soccer Instruction in professional settings and practice skills in team format play. They will learn about the rules of the game, etiquette, sportsmanship, positive attitudes, fair play, self-esteem, taking responsibility for choices and management of emotions. These life skills are integrated throughout the Soccer program, and instructors routinely demonstrate how they apply to situations in all aspects of life. Nutrition and Healthy lifestyles are stressed both in the Classroom setting and on the Soccer Field. Healthy Snacks will be provided. The ACN YOUTH CAPACITY BUILDING program is Fortunate to have a corpse of Volunteers willing to dedicate to the program and are available to work with the children on improving their academic skills. Seeking Volunteers from some of the community based Universities/colleges who will take an active role in the homework area, working individually with the students using current homework assignments. In the computer lab, Volunteer tutors will help the students improve their keyboarding skills and show them how to use the computer for research. They will read aloud with the students and give quizzes on tapes and videos to improve comprehension. When the college/university students volunteers are not on campus, volunteers from local Churches will assume the role of tutors.

The Comprehensive Community Hospice Program of Parker Jewish Institute is looking for people who would like to volunteer as a doula, going out to patients' homes and extending the hand of reassurance, offering a smile that warms the heart, and the words that say everything will be okay. Volunteer Doulas will help patients and families cope with the process of dying, remaining at the bedside as life ends. \\\"Doula\\\" is a Greek word that means \\\"woman servant or caregiver.\\\" Today it is associated with individuals who provide physical assistance and emotional support during and/or after childbirth. This proposed program aims to mirror the concept by providing the same type of support at the final phase of a terminal illness. This initiative will place a focus on planning for death with the elderly patient and family if there is one, and will provide a continuous around the clock vigil as death becomes imminent. The program will help the elderly patient who lacks family or adequate caregiver support to die comfortably, without fear of being alone. Even when surrounded by loved ones, individuals with a terminal illness and those closest to them may feel isolated as they face the end of life. As the end of life approaches, patients and families struggle with anxiety and fear; exhaustion; loved ones often feel alone, unprepared and afraid; and opportunities to explore meaning go unaddressed. Hospice Doulas provide emotional support and comfort to patients and their loved ones in the final phase of a terminal illness. Our End-of-Life (EOL) Doula volunteers will receive thorough training in understanding the dying process and in the skills that help bring peace and comfort to all involved. This free two-day training includes learning how to do guided visualization, help create rituals, provide simple physical support, offer sacred presence, as well as how to create spiritual and emotional legacies. Parker Jewish institute will be hosting a free two-day Doula training workshop on Saturday 10/28/17 and Sunday 10/29/17 from 9:00am-6:00pm. Breakfast and lunch will be served. A certificate will be awarded upon completion of this workshop. If you are interested in attending, please call the Hospice Program's Volunteer Doula Coordinator at 718-289-2134, or email volunteer-nerken@parkerinstitute.org. Doulas can come from any background and no experience is required. They typically work in as part of a team. They usually sit quietly with a patient, talk with them and offer support, comfort and companionship.

Organization Description: The National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) and Be The Match (BTM) is the global leader in providing marrow, PBSC, and umbilical cord blood transplants to patients with leukemia, lymphoma, and other diseases. The nonprofit organization matches patients with donors, educates health care professionals, supports patients and their families, and conducts research so more lives can be saved. Be The Match Walk+Run Overview: Be The Match Walk+Run is a fundraising event that helps patients with blood cancers like leukemia find a marrow donor and receive a life-saving transplant. Every four minutes someone is diagnosed with a blood cancer. It can happen to anyone at any time. But so can a cure - a marrow transplant. The cure for blood cancer is in the hands of ordinary people. Most of us won&rsquo;t have a marrow donor in our family and Be The Match matches volunteer marrow donors with patients who need them.

The New York Be The Match Walk+Run takes place in the fall, usually October. This is a leadership opportunity for individuals looking to share or develop their experience in fundraising and community engagement. Key Responsibilities The primary role of the LOC is to lead the fundraising efforts of the Be The Match Walk+Run. The LOC acts as an ambassador of Be The Match to the local community and acts as a local grassroots promotions team. Individual roles vary depending upon current membership/vacancies and volunteers' strengths and skill sets. The ideal LOC structure includes a Chair and members focused on sponsorships, entertainment, registration, team recruitment, in-kind donations, event promotions, and volunteer recruitment. Location Volunteer in the New York area with the local LOC volunteers and staff Development Manager. Time Commitment The LOC is most active in the 5-6 months leading up to an event. LOC volunteers can expect to spend around 15-20 hours a month on committee work, but this can vary by role and based on your own availability. LOC volunteers are expected to attend meetings/conference calls and local promotional events and to work with Be The Match staff in regards to their specific functional area during the planning period and event weekend. Qualifications * Self-motivated, strong interest in fundraising * Willing to talk to people to engage them in the event * Strong interpersonal and communication skills with the ability to work with office tools such as Microsoft Word and Excel Be The Match Walk+Run Overview Be The Match Walk+Run is a fundraising event that helps patients with blood cancers like leukemia find a marrow donor and receive a life-saving transplant. Every four minutes someone is diagnosed with a blood cancer. It can happen to anyone at any time. But so can a cure - a marrow transplant. The cure for blood cancer is in the hands of ordinary people. Most of us won&rsquo;t have a marrow donor in our family and Be The Match matches volunteer marrow donors with patients who need them.

If you love to garden and can help - or just want to be part of a movement in which you are an active participant in food justice - working with students and teachers to create access to fresh fruits and vegetables and healthy options, this is for you. We accept all offers of volunteerism on any day. We want partners also to help us meet with students to organize our market so we can expand to a real farmers market. Right now, students and teachers serve fresh orange juice and fresh juices at the morning market. We plan to expand hours - hopefully to afterschool - and also offerings - parfaits, smoothies, icies, and more... Can you help us build? Please send us an email at info@seedsinthemiddle.org and tell us what you can do and what hours you are available. Students can also meet during their lunch hour : 11:15- 12 noon Flatbush is one of the e neighborhoods ranked among NYC's most food-insecure zones, by the NYC Health Dept. and multiple studies. There is limited access to fruits and vegetables and overwhelming junk food options. These neighborhoods have among the highest obesity, diabetes, heart disease rates in the city - mainly due to lack of access to affordable fresh produce and healthy activities. Be the change! We also plan to hold an all-day Saturday market in June - so you can also volunteer for that. But again - we take all offers! HELP TEACHERS AND STUDENTS BUILD THEIR GARDEN HELP STUDENTS IN THEIR HIP2B HEALTHY MARKET and help us expand to a full farmers market - run by students! We give community service credits.

We ask you to share an hour or two a week, more if you're able to provide comfort and caring to those who will provide you with much more than you will ever imagine. Volunteer Opportunities: Companionship Volunteers work directly with patients providing companionship, offering friendly visits, reading to patients, writing letters, offering a gentle touch or sharing a quiet moment.

Certification is required and hospice training is provided. Pet Therapy Volunteers provide companionship from our certified therapy dogs. Pet therapy provides numerous benefits like encouraging movement and physical stimulation and it provides mental benefits like socialization, mental stimulation, companionship, and unconditional love. Please consider sharing your loving pet with us and bring some much needed smiles. Pets must be certified as therapy animals by an organization like TDI Therapy Dogs International- see website here http://www.tdi-dog.org/ or in South Jersey - Bright and Beautiful Therapy Dogs - see website here http://www.golden-dogs.org/ Music Volunteers are volunteers who specialize in sharing songs or instrumental music with patients and their loved ones. Whether the Music Volunteer is sharing an existing musical skill or playing music via the radio or digital device, the goal is to enhance the quality of life of our patients. Often, regularly scheduled visits are requested, however Music Volunteers may also be asked to provide musical visits on an occasional basis for one patient/family or for a group of patients at a facility as outreach for the local hospice agency. Hospice is built on the philosophy that we care for our patients in mind, body and soul. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network.

A child with a CASA is more likely to find a permanent home, spend less time in foster care, and perform better in school. Champion one of these children from your community and safeguard a child&rsquo;s well being through advocacy in the court today. What does a CASA do? A CASA is integral in helping the Court in determining the appropriate permanent plan for the child. We ensure abuse and neglect doesn&rsquo;t continue at the hand&rsquo;s of the court. A CASA forges a connection with the child/children they are matched with. They build their trust and discover what their needs are. They meet with the children at least once a month. An advocate also examines their child's health and education records and meet with their caregivers, school, therapists and other professionals. Once they identify what the child&rsquo;s needs are, they write a report and advocate for a child&rsquo;s needs in court. Our staff and peer coordinators are with you every step of the way to support you and help you succeed. No special skills or specific backgrounds are needed. Advocates must be 21+ and have the ability to commit to 18 - 24 months of service. The next training session will be held Summer 2018 around mid-June/July.
