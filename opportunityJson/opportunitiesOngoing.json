Volunteer Opportunities: Companionship Volunteers work directly with patients providing companionship, offering friendly visits, reading to patients, writing letters, offering a gentle touch or sharing a quiet moment. Complementary Volunteers are certified/trained professionals who can provide complementary modalities of reflexology, music, imagery and touch therapies such as Reiki, massage, therapeutic touch and healing hands. Pet Therapy Volunteers provide certified/trained pets who visit with patients. These animals provide loving memories for some and give unconditional love helping our patients feel connected to a larger world.

It's easy for you to get involved and help save more animals simply by driving a leg in this relay. How it works: Click the I WANT TO HELP button. When an animal rescue organization posts a transport request, we will search to see if it matches your profile (if you're available and within the distance) and then send you an e-mail. Then you simply click on the leg that you can cover and everyone else will see that you've signed up for that leg. You'll get communications from the transport coordinator and, once the transport is a \\\"go\\\", you simply drive to the meeting place, load up the animals, and drive them to the next meeting place to hand them off to the next volunteer. You'll get plenty of doggy kisses and thank you's along the way as the animals know you are there to help them.

Sprout is a non-profit organization based in New York City focused on providing innovative programs for adults with developmental disabilities.With our network of resources and dedicated volunteers, which we call leaders, Sprout opens up fascinating new worlds to people with disabilities. Sprout's Overnight Vacations Program is looking for individuals who have the energy, motivation and desire to work with adults with developmental disabilities. What do Sprout leaders do? Sprout leaders' primary goal is to give adults with developmental disabilities the opportunity to experience and enjoy recreational, educational and leisure activities through overnight vacations. Leaders are responsible for the overall safety and enjoyment of their group, 24 hours a day, while on a Sprout trip. Duties include safety monitoring, personal hygiene assistance, providing physical and emotional support, activity planning, budgeting, logistics, and enhancing fun. The work is hard yet immensely rewarding as you develop leadership skills and gain insight into your own abilities. What type of training is provided? Leaders must complete a pre-service training, which provides the necessary procedures and tools to run a successful and enjoyable vacation. Leaders who are drivers receive extra training on how to safely drive our 15-passenger vans. In addition, all leaders receive a copy of Sprout's Leadership Handbook to help with policies and guidelines. What is the time commitment? Sprout vacations last 3 - 7 days depending on the time of year and destination of the trip. When a leader is selected for an overnight vacation, Sprout asks that the leader dedicate themselves to stay with their group throughout the entire duration of the vacation. Some leaders only choose to lead one trip a year while others spend several months with us leading up to 8 trips or more. Sprout strives to make our program flexible for our leaders based on the amount of time leaders can give. Do leaders have any free or personal time while on a trip? Sprout trips are working vacations for the leaders who choose to participate. Because Sprout leaders are responsible for their group 24 hours a day, there is no free or personal time allotted. In order to give our participants the opportunity to experience and enjoy a vacation, Sprout leaders must be available at all times to provide the support any one participant may need. What type of trips can Sprout leaders expect to join? A majority of Sprout trips take place within a day's drive of New York City. Destinations include Atlantic City, Amish Country, Boston, Lake George, Cleveland, Maine and Virginia Beach. Exotic trips like cruises, Hawaii, and Europe are presented to leaders who have demonstrated high levels of commitment, service hours and have gained positive feedback from participants and Sprout office staff. Are there any special skills or requirements? No special background or education is required to become a Sprout leader. We encourage people from all cultures and professions, and of all ethnic and educational backgrounds. Once accepted into the program, you will receive the necessary tools to sign up for outings and how to assist our participants. Requirements include: -21+ years old -Provide references -Participate in training session -Willingness to complete necessary background checks -Evaluate participants' behavior -Fluent English -Willing to drive a 15 passenger van -Love to travel & have fun!

As Brooklyn&rsquo;s largest noncommercial tax provider, we have grown to cover most of central Brooklyn along with southern Brooklyn. This is, in large part, thanks to our volunteer tax preparers. Volunteer Tax Preparers will be tasked with completing high quality tax returns for low- and middle-income Brooklynites. Our ideal tax preparer would have a high interest and motivation for building on their tax preparation experience. They should also have a passion for helping the members of our community who need it most. Most of all, our volunteers should be able to practice patience, good customer service skills, and have a great sense of humor! This is a great opportunity to build valuable work experience, meet new friends, and help people who need it. Benefits Wide ranging benefits include learning new skills or building on valuable professional experience with active work duties. We have served as professional references for many of our volunteers. CPAs, Attorneys, and Enrolled Agents also receive Continuing Education Credits upon completion of volunteer service in this program. Build a sense of achievement for directly positively affecting your fellow Brooklynites by providing them with top quality tax service without the predatory service fees associated with retail tax providers. If that isn&rsquo;t enough for you to sign up, we&rsquo;ll also provide snacks. General Requirements All volunteers are welcome! If you don't have any tax experience, no problem! We provide training.

Grace Healthcare Services is a Community-based Hospice program that cares for Veterans at the end of life. Volunteers are an essential component of this care. WHY A NEED FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS? -Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect to patients who have served our country. -Veterans share a common bond and code of conduct. -The camaraderie that exists between Veterans has proven to be a great support for the Veterans we care for. As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee. If you are interested or have questions please contact the Grace Healthcare Services Volunteer Department at 732-225-4100 and ask for Ms. Moynihan to inquire about the Veteran-to-Veteran Volunteer Program.

The Comprehensive Community Hospice Program of Parker Jewish Institute is looking for people who would like to volunteer as a doula, going out to patients' homes and extending the hand of reassurance, offering a smile that warms the heart, and the words that say everything will be okay. Volunteer Doulas will help patients and families cope with the process of dying, remaining at the bedside as life ends. \\\"Doula\\\" is a Greek word that means \\\"woman servant or caregiver.\\\" Today it is associated with individuals who provide physical assistance and emotional support during and/or after childbirth. This proposed program aims to mirror the concept by providing the same type of support at the final phase of a terminal illness. This initiative will place a focus on planning for death with the elderly patient and family if there is one, and will provide a continuous around the clock vigil as death becomes imminent. The program will help the elderly patient who lacks family or adequate caregiver support to die comfortably, without fear of being alone. Even when surrounded by loved ones, individuals with a terminal illness and those closest to them may feel isolated as they face the end of life. As the end of life approaches, patients and families struggle with anxiety and fear; exhaustion; loved ones often feel alone, unprepared and afraid; and opportunities to explore meaning go unaddressed. Hospice Doulas provide emotional support and comfort to patients and their loved ones in the final phase of a terminal illness. Our End-of-Life (EOL) Doula volunteers will receive thorough training in understanding the dying process and in the skills that help bring peace and comfort to all involved. This free two-day training includes learning how to do guided visualization, help create rituals, provide simple physical support, offer sacred presence, as well as how to create spiritual and emotional legacies. Parker Jewish institute will be hosting a free two-day Doula training workshop on Saturday 10/28/17 and Sunday 10/29/17 from 9:00am-6:00pm. Breakfast and lunch will be served. A certificate will be awarded upon completion of this workshop. If you are interested in attending, please call the Hospice Program's Volunteer Doula Coordinator at 718-289-2134, or email volunteer-nerken@parkerinstitute.org. Doulas can come from any background and no experience is required. They typically work in as part of a team. They usually sit quietly with a patient, talk with them and offer support, comfort and companionship. Parker Jewish institute will be hosting a free two-day Doula training workshop on Saturday 10/28/17 and Sunday 10/29/17 from 9:00am-6:00pm. Breakfast and lunch will be served.

Hospice volunteers enhance the quality of life and help reduce the burden for family caregivers by providing support, assistance, in patient&rsquo;s homes, in nursing homes, and assisted living facilities. To be a volunteer, there is no special requirement other than a sincere desire to help people and the ability to listen. The most important thing you can do is be there for patients to reassure them they are not alone. It is not an easy undertaking, but it can enrich your life well as patients and families. Hospice volunteers can commit to as little or as much time as they wish. Some volunteers provide several hours of service each week while others commit to a few hours each month. Serving as valued members of the hospice team, for just a few hours of your time you can make a significant impact on the lives of patients and their loved ones. There are many opportunities to share your time and talents as a volunteer and support patients, their loved ones dealing with end of life. Opportunities include: Hospice Doulas Bereavement/Grief Patient Friendly Visits Legacy Projects Administrative Support Community Education Help Recruiting Other Volunteers Note: We ask that those who have recently lost a loved one wait a year before becoming a hospice volunteer.

The course focuses on the relevance of political theory in the examination and solution of current political controversies. The course will cover such themes as justice, legitimacy, civil liberties, civil disobedience, the nature of man, society and the state. Focus will be on great writings in political thought from all periods. Classes are scheduled Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9:30AM-10:40AM.

In this role, you would collaborate with an instructor to improve students&rsquo; performance while being supported and guided by an experienced academic support professional. All tutors for Political Science classes are expected to commit a minimum of one hour and fifteen minutes in-class, and two hours availability outside of class each week to support students having difficulty with the material.

As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee.

Then join a new initiative with Seeds in the Middle to give every child a chance to learn the academic skills to gain entry into New York City's top high schools - starting as early as 3rd or 4th grade. Given MLK Day of Service is coming up, based on response - we might launch this for Martin Luther King Day to honor his commitment to civil rights. Education is key. Why? Despite increasing funding and initiatives, the percentage of African-American and Latino students in NYC is far below their numbers in the NYC population. See the article here - showing in 2017 that only 10 percent of the seats offered went to minority students. https://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2017/03/08/only-10-percent-of-offers-at-new-york-citys-specialized-high-schools-went-to-black-and-hispanic-students/ Who are we? Seeds in the Middle has been working with students, faculties and parents and the community in central Brooklyn since 2010. We have seen the challenges and want to work closely with people who care to give children real chances to get the same access to top colleges as those in more affluent communities. We think we have an innovative solution to helping students achieve so they can have an equal shot at these schools - including competitive schools like LaGuardia High School of Performing Arts or Midwood or Murrow or any other school recognized as top by the most competitive colleges. That's you! Help us create a new pathway for students! Empower real change. Volunteers are asked to commit at least two hours a week - probably weekends - for at least one month, but preferably for three months or years to work with a student on special skills. You must: sign that commitment when you finish your term, explain to the next tutor what you are working on with the student confer with our certified educators for guidance so you know exactly what they need to work on. STUDENTS - WE CAN GIVE COMMUNITY SERVICE HOURS FOR THIS. Locations? May vary - it might be Brooklyn Central Library near Grand Army Plaza or a school in Brownsville, Flatbush or Crown Heights, Brooklyn or maybe right at Stuyvesant High School or one of the top high schools. If you have a location near a train, let us know. Who are the students you will tutor? Each student must write a letter or essay, saying why he or she wants to go to a top high school and signing, with a parent, their commitment to coming every week for as long as it takes. We are starting at 3rd or 4th grade, and offer this to students through 8th grade. We hope to launch this on MLK weekend 2018 - so respond right away. PS - We would like to ask every volunteer to donate $50 or anything to help support our efforts. If you just want to tutor and cannot give, that is okay. But this is an unfunded program, so we are asking for donations to pay the people who are creating and organizing these opportunities and to administer this. All donations are tax-deductible. If you are willing to fundraise at all - even a bake sale - for our efforts, we would truly appreciate. Our goal is $20,000 and we want to offer tutors to as many children who want it - can be 100 or more... you can see what we do at seedsinthemiddle.org and on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/seedsinthemiddle/ What is our goal? To get at least 20 students into any of these schools, maybe more. But our initial goal is to ensure at least 20 students get the education necessary to pass the specialized high school test or other tests to go to the school of their choice - who - WITHOUT YOU - would never get a chance to get in. More info? Email - info@seedsinthemiddle.org Please write us and tell us: Who you are Days you are available What is your commitment - how many weeks at 2 x a week Where are you willing to travel?

Our nonprofit focuses on news about making the world a better place, particularly news related to topics such as global poverty, nonprofits, climate change and human rights. All volunteering is via the computer -- you can be anywhere in the world. The Daily Source is truly a 21st century journalism site. Our online software is incredibly easy to use and automates most of the layout process. Just drag and drop articles from one location to another and the page adjusts itself automatically. Editing the headlines is as easy as using Microsoft Word or sending an e-mail. You will receive guidance from our senior editors who are some of the top newspaper journalists in the U.S. Besides laying out the front page, you will find articles, videos, columns and other material from around the Internet for use on the site and make the final decision of what goes on the site. You will be doing real stuff that directly impacts our front page and our nonprofit's mission to help the world. You will also gain invaluable experience that will build your skills and look great on a resume. Some of our volunteers have gone on to work in the journalism field. Two of our volunteers started their own non-profit organization after eight months of volunteering with us. One of our editors was hired full-time by Wired.com and another was hired by Congress as the official congressional photographer of senators at public events. We have an extensive training process that is about a month long, so if we are going to train you, we need you to do a certain amount of hours in all to make it worth the time we put into it. Therefore, the Front Page Editor role is a minimum of 15 hours per week for a minimum of six months. If you can volunteer 20 hours or higher a week, then the minimum is only five months, or you can do 12 hours a week for seven and a half months. We tend to give preference to applicants who can do a sizable number of hours. All editors are credited at the bottom of the site each day, and daily editions are archived so your friends, family and future employers will see what you were part of creating. To view our front page, visit - http://dailysource.org/ To read more about us, view the links here - http://dailysource.org/about/site We usually also have the following openings (minimum hours per week and minimum number of months are in parenthesis). All these positions are telecommute so you don&rsquo;t have to drive or dress up, and can work from the comfort of your home. You might also be able to use our local Internet location, though there is some cost for that so virtual is preferred. If you apply for a position, you should view your commitment to it the same as if it were a paid position. We treat volunteers like normal staff and rely on them like staff. Our site is 99% volunteer run and we all depend on each other to make it a success. Please do not apply if you are viewing this opportunity as \\\"just a volunteer position\\\" and would treat it as less important than paid positions or other commitments you have. If you are in school, volunteering with us can function as an internship. Interns can usually receive credit with their school for their internships. Content Editor (10 hours a week for a minimum of 6 months): Searches the Internet for high quality articles, columns, editorials and videos, adds them to our system, and ranks them by quality. The front page editors pick from these to publish on the front page. Also does research and fact-checking when needed. This requires Internet surfing skills, strong understanding and judgment of the news, and attention to detail. Marketing and Social Media (6 hours a week for a minimum of 5 months): Help research potential media outlets and blogs to cover our site, e-mail our press releases to them, and keep track of coverage of our site that has occurred. We have a great website and need to get the word out about it. Help promote the website by updating our Facebook, Twitter and other social media pages, attracting new followers, and interacting with our existing followers. No marketing experience required, but you must be familiar with social media and be good at communicating. If you're interested in volunteering, please email us at volunteer@dailysource.org and let us know: * Which position or positions are you interested in? * How many hours per week and how many months can you do? We tend to give preference to people who can do more hours. * A description of your past work/volunteer experience and education, or a resume or a link to a LinkedIn profile. You can also apply directly through this website by clicking the button for that, and giving us the same information.

Don't Walk By is a project of the Rescue Alliance, a coalition of faith-based organizations, including The Salvation Army, engaged in addressing homelessness and housing fragility. Each Saturday in February, in one of four sections of Manhattan per Saturday (uptown, eastside, westside, and downtown), volunteer teams walk the streets and subways of an assigned area engaging with homeless neighbors they may encounter distributing small items (eg. hygiene kits, clean socks, etc.) and extending an invitation to dinner at an anchor church. If accepted, guests are offered a van trip to the church. At the anchor church, guests are provided a dignified sit-down dinner (eg. tablecloths, centerpieces, printed menus, servers, etc.). Every guest is invited to spend the evening housed in a Rescue Alliance member/partner shelter (eg. NYC Rescue Mission, All Angels' Church). Our hope is that accepting this offer will lead to longer-term case management, the end goal being life-transformation that includes dignity, stable housing, independence, and, where needed, sobriety. In addition to a meal and invitation to shelter, other services provided at the anchor church include: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit sign-up Distribution of backpacks, winter coats, SafeLink cell phones, and other items Legal advice Medical services including HIV testing, optometry w/ free glasses, podiatry, blood pressure checks, etc. Referrals to detox, drug and alcohol rehabilitation, and mental health services This year, The Salvation Army is the lead coordinator of this outreach working with multiple Rescue Alliance members/partners (eg. Bowery Mission, Hope For New York, NYC Relief, New York Presbyterian Hospital, etc.) each taking lead over several included functions. You can be part of this opportunity to support our homeless neighbors through multiple volunteer roles (eg. street team member or leader, driver, driver's assistant, hosts, table hosts, runners, servers).

Reading Parties last about an hour and run throughout the year during business hours from Tuesday-Friday.

Complementary Volunteers are certified/trained professionals who can provide complementary modalities of reflexologly, music, Reiki, & massage.

Please consider sharing your loving pet with us and bring some much needed smiles. Pets must be certified as therapy animals by an organization like TDI Therapy Dogs International- see website here http://www.tdi-dog.org/ Music Volunteers are volunteers who specialize in sharing songs or instrumental music with patients and their loved ones. Whether the Music Volunteer is sharing an existing musical skill or playing music via the radio or digital device, the goal is to enhance the quality of life of our patients. Often, regularly scheduled visits are requested, however Music Volunteers may also be asked to provide musical visits on an occasional basis for one patient/family or for a group of patients at a facility as outreach for the local hospice agency. Hospice is built on the philosophy that we care for our patients in mind, body and soul. Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, memory bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network. They often make phone calls to check up on family members and also send cards of comfort and care.

Information about the CLEAR program: The Union County C.L.E.A.R. program is a collaborative effort that offers free recovery assistance to families and individuals wanting to recover from addiction. If you need help with an addiction, you can walk into the Union County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office or the Union County Police Department and get connected to the help you need. Law enforcement will greet you with compassion and understanding and will bring in a recovery coach who can help you figure out what your next step should be. Not only that-CLEAR coaches will follow up with you for several months after treatment to provide support and keep you connected to the resources you need to recover. Anyone in possession of illegal substances and paraphernalia can turn it in without fear of arrest, prosecution or questioning from law enforcement. Funding for Union County CLEAR is made possible by the County of Union and the Union County Board of Chosen Freeholder&rsquo;s. UC CLEAR participants without insurance can access inpatient detox and residential substance use treatment through our contracted treatment providers free of charge. A recovery coach is someone who has been there, who has experienced addiction and found stable, long-term recovery.

One day, he will provide enhanced independence and mobility to a person with disabilities - whether they're blind or visually impaired, or have a disability other than blindness.

Each year, the Guide Dog Foundation breeds about 300 exceptional puppies, and it's vital that Bosley and other pups like him spend the first year of their lives with surrounded by the love and security of volunteer foster families called puppy walkers. Puppy walkers help Foundation puppies grow up to be confident dogs. What's involved in raising a Guide Dog Foundation puppy? Bosley went to live with his puppy walkers when he was about nine weeks old. He's learning basic obedience and social skills while being exposed to many different situations. People who raise Guide Dog Foundation puppies say it is the most rewarding thing they've ever done. Puppy raisers come from everywhere - stay-at-home moms or dads, teachers, college students, retirees, people with flexible work environments - and are crucial members of the Guide Dog Foundation family. By opening their hearts and homes to a puppy, a puppy raiser plays a crucial role in helping a person with disabilities live an independent life. Every puppy walker family works with a Guide Dog Foundation puppy adviser, who is available to answer questions and offer guidance and support. When he is about 14 months old, Bosley will return to the Guide Dog Foundation's Smithtown campus to begin his training as a guide or service dog. Puppy raisers will admit it's tough to say good-bye, but when they see the pup they raised take its place at the side of someone with disabilities, the ache they feel turns pride.

The team is looking for experienced people in public speaking, forensics (Competitive Speech and Debate), and drama/acting advisers who are willing to donate their time in getting the team prepared for a busy tournament season ahead. More specifically, the QCSS is looking for \\\"coaches\\\" that could assist the team in providing constructive feedback in delivery, diction, overall presentation, and topic selections throughout the academic year. I know that this might be a lot to ask, but even a small contribution will help in a big way! Just think of it, Queens College hasn't had an active speech team in over 30 years, but now you can help change that! If you - or anyone with public speaking, debate, or drama/acting experience - are interested in participating within this exciting new endeavor, then please do not hesitate to contact me. We need as much help we get especially when we're preparing for our first tournament in October. Lastly, I want to also mention that the team will not only be dedicated to competing within tournaments. Hopefully, the team will seek ways to contribute to the forensics and the Queens College academic community by hosting future speech/debate tournaments at QC, bake sales, and community service endeavors that empower others to serve, grow, and succeed at this wonderful college. This will be a team not measured by the number of trophies or medals won - but rather - the team will be one that will be measured by the number of hearts, minds, and lives that we can touch. We're in for an exhilirating new journey and I am confident that we will succeed in our mission of bringing this exciting new program into fruition.

You can learn more about us at souldeevas.wixsite.com/neos As a Sorority member, you will do community service projects that are both virtual and physical in nature. For instance, we are writing to students in other countries to help them improve their understanding of the English language and their English writing skills. You will be assigned to one (or more) pen pals to write to. If you have a specific skill, like dancing, stepping or cheerleading, you might be assigned to work with a local dance company and help their girls learn the routines. You may also participate in talent shows to help raise money for local charities. Being a part of Nu Sigma Theta doesn't take up a lot of your time. Every month, we send around a list of projects and activities that are happening. You can participate in the projects and activities that mean the most to you and/or that you have time to do. Even when there are \\\"in-person\\\" activities, they are never mandatory. Some members have opted for a simply virtual membership and that is fine. Your level of participation is up to you. We keep track of the projects that you work on and assign hours to them so that they can be verified for your school. It's not only a service organization, but a sisterhood. You'll be exposed to other sisters in other states and to the older sisters in New York City. There will be some social activities as well (which again, are not mandatory). When we have meetings, they are generally in Manhattan (Penn Station area) or in Brooklyn (Bed-Stuy area).

Guiding Principles As a board member, I understand that I owe duties of care, loyalty, and obedience to the organization and the children it serves. The duty of care is the duty to monitor Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s activities, see that its mission is being accomplished, and guard its financial resources. The duty of loyalty is the duty to avoid conflicts of interest. The duty of obedience is to be faithful to Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s mission and to comply with the law. I will uphold these duties and do my utmost to ensure that Maya&rsquo;s Hope performs its mission and achieves its goals. Principal Commitments Act with integrity and represent the interests of all people served by the organization. Recognize that decisions of the board can be made only by a majority vote at a) a board meeting or b) in writing. Respect the majority decisions of the board. Participate in: Board self-evaluation programs. Board development workshops, seminars, and other educational events that enhance skills as a board member. Handle information with discretion and confidentiality as necessary. Exercise authority as a board member only when acting in a meeting with the full board or as delegated by the board with members. Collaborate with members who serve this board and leave personal prejudices out of all board discussions. Represent Maya&rsquo;s Hope in a positive and supportive manner at all times. Display courteous conduct at all board and committee meetings. Refrain from intruding on administrative issues that are the responsibility of management, except to monitor the results of the organization. Monitor the financial condition of the organization. Understand and comply with the bylaws of Maya&rsquo;s Hope. Avoid conflicts of interest between my position as a board member and my personal or professional life (as referenced in Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s Conflict of Interest Policy.) If such a conflict does arise, I will disclose that conflict to the board and refrain from voting on matters in which I have conflict. Liability of Board Members As a fully incorporated non-profit, Maya&rsquo;s Hope enjoys the same limited liability that any corporation does. Corporations offer the protection of limited liability to corporate directors and officers. Limited liability means that the organization's directors and officers have limited personal liability for business debts. Generally, creditors can only go after corporate assets and insurance to satisfy liabilities incurred by the corporation. This principle applies, however, only when the board has fulfilled its basic duties, such as the duty of care. A board member is legally bound to exercise reasonable care when he or she makes a decision for the organization. Reasonable care is what an 'ordinarily prudent' person in a similar situation would do. Examples of when a board member may have personal liability include (but are not limited to) when a board member: personally and directly injures someone. personally guarantees a bank loan or a business debt on which the corporation defaults, or behaves in a fraudulent or illegal manner that causes harm, Maya&rsquo;s Hope maintains a Directors & Officers liability insurance policy. Responsibilities of Secretary: Meeting Minutes The primary task of the secretary of an executive board is to record and maintain the minutes of each board meeting. Meeting minutes are detail reports that highlight the predetermined agenda of each conference as well as what actually took place. For example, a secretary may notate the following: \\\"The meeting began at 11 a.m. The first order of business was for the president to discuss potential changes to the organization&rsquo;s mission statement; however, he was unable to attend the gathering due to medical reasons. The issue was put on hold until a later date.\\\" Record Maintenance As the custodian of corporate records, the secretary of an executive board must maintain all company files in a manner compliant with organizational policies as well as any laws that regulate the industry. These documents may include the firm&rsquo;s article of incorporation, bylaws and employee contact lists, as well as financial records. He must also develop and enforce policies regarding access to these confidential files. Security controls, such as who can access which files and what approvals are needed to do so, are examples of the many procedures he must implement. Depending on the industry in which the company does business, the secretary of the executive board may be required to file certain documents with the government. For example, a nonprofit organization must meet certain criteria to maintain its tax-exempt status. It is often the responsibility of the secretary to ensure that all necessary paperwork is completed and returned to the Internal Revenue Service. Organizational Representative It is not uncommon for the secretary of an executive board to serve as its signing officer. This designation gives her the authority to sign documents, such as contracts, checks and credit applications, on behalf of the organization. Because this responsibility wields so much power, many firms implement a system of checks and balances so it is not abused. For instance, before signing a service agreement, the secretary may need the express written permission of two other board members. She must follow these guidelines or risk termination and, in severe cases, criminal prosecution.", "title": "Board Member Opening at Maya's Hope", "zipcode": "10001", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D2862432%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "Maya's Hope"}, {"end": null, "description": "ChickTech New York is creating a community of women, girls, and supporters empowered and driven by our mission to get and keep women & girls in high tech.

We are leading a movement to encourage students, faculty, recent graduates, high school students, and parents to advocate for these changes. The Petition Colleges and universities could save students billions of dollars a year on textbooks by adopting these policies. We call on them to: Consider the cost when selecting textbooks. Use free Open Source textbooks whenever possible. Do not require university-specific editions or (unless essential) the latest edition, which undermine the used book market. Refrain from requiring students to purchase expensive access codes for homework assignments and quizzes. Tell students what textbooks are required and what they cost before registration begins so they have time to shop for savings. Have college bookstores transparently serve students, rather than profit off of them. Inform students of scholarships to fund textbooks.

A pioneering nonprofit, Heifer International, has shown that nonprofits can capture some of that money by making donations, given in a friend&rsquo;s name, feel like a present. It works! They raise $115 million a year this way. Imagine how much more gift money could be captured by nonprofits addressing popular causes, including your favorites. The challenge is that it is too daunting for most nonprofits to provide a gift-like experience: tangible donation opportunities, wish lists, gift registries, and personalized printed greeting cards. About www.ChangingThePresent.org Our nonprofit site provides a gift-like experience, which helps 400 leading nonprofits capture money normally spent on traditional presents. The NY Times called it an \\\"amazon.com of the nonprofit world.\\\" We are now about to invite all million nonprofits to join the site. We are also providing each with their own private, charitable gift sites so they can send supporters without exposing them to other nonprofits. See a sample: http://SampleNGO.GiftsForHumanity.org.

We offer four great benefits: Take on a leadership role Enhance your resume Make a difference Generate funds for college tuition and textbooks We are looking for passionate, energetic students with exceptional skills. This is an outstanding leadership opportunity in an innovative start-up nonprofit organization. About ClassWish ClassWish is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in NYC and working nationwide. Our initial focus was in providing resources for K-12 students. We are now turning attention to help generate funds for nonprofits and for college tuition and textbooks, as well. We offer high-achieving students unparalleled opportunities to assume responsibility, use their skills, gain experience, and make a difference--and provide relief from the cost of college tuition and textbooks. Here are the problems we are tackling: We are tackling two problems at once: Nonprofits need far more funding to fulfill their missions, and schools need far more resources for kids (books, computers, art supplies, musical instruments, science equipment, and sports equipment are all in desperately short supply). Students and their families are burdened by the skyrocketing cost of college tuition and textbooks. (By the way, be sure to see www.TuitionRevolution.org). Our Approach ClassWish is launching a new initiative to address these needs. Soon, students and their families will be able to earn an average of 8% of what they spend at stores, grocers, gas stations, restaurants, hotels, and airlines, and they will be able to direct that to their favorite schools, teachers, nonprofits, or even their own tuition and textbooks. What Campus Reps Will Do ClassWish Campus Reps will help raise awareness of this opportunity for students, professors, and their families to generate funding for schools, nonprofits, and college tuition. We will recruit a campus rep on each college campus. They, in turn, will recruit additional campus reps to focus on each of these areas: Greek life Residence halls Athletics Student government Student clubs and organizations Professors and administration Alumni Student media Social media Events Graphics Communications Marketing We Want to Hear From Outstanding Students Interested in becoming a Campus Rep?

FAQ - Review ClassWish.org&rsquo;s outstanding internship program here: Is this a business or a nonprofit? ClassWish is a nonprofit, but we use the latest techniques from the business world to make a leveraged, scalable and financially-self sustaining difference in the lives of tens of millions of children. This sounds ambitious! Daniel Burnham, the great Chicago architect, said \\\"Make no little plans; they have not the power to stir men&rsquo;s souls.\\\" (Nor women&rsquo;s, we hasten to add). Little plans also do not have the power to provide a better education to 56 million kids who deserve more than they are getting today. We face a crushing need in schools, have a solid plan to address it, and with your help, we intend to grow this very large and very fast. Where are you located? We are in Manhattan, conveniently located right across from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. Four express subway stops, LIRR, and the PATH train are all within one block. We also hire interns to work remotely from other cities. What skills and experience are you looking for? We seek a wide range of skills: graphic designers, videographers, writers, researchers, creative thinkers, analytical sorts, community organizers, social media stars, people with great communication skills, MBA students, and more. I looked at your site and have some suggestions. Great! This is a collaborative project, and we want to hear from you. Your ClassWish review will be helpful. Is this a paid internship? We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your rsum, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions. Do check to see if your school offers a stipend program. When will you select the interns? We&rsquo;re agile. When we see a great candidate, we extend an invitation immediately. We won&rsquo;t keep you waiting for a decision. What dates will the internship run? We are flexible. Tell us what you are looking for. What are the hours? We welcome full-time and part-time interns. Let us know what works for you. What will I need to bring? Brains, heart, passion, energy, a notebook computer (as an early-stage nonprofit, we just can&rsquo;t afford to buy dozens of machines), and a passion to make an immediate improvement to the education of tens of millions of children. Sounds exciting! How can I apply? Please send a short cover letter and an impressive resume to interns @ ClassWish . org.", "title": "Make a Difference.

FAQ - Review ClassWish.org&rsquo;s outstanding internship program here: Is this a business or a nonprofit? ClassWish is a nonprofit, and we are working with Have to Have, an exciting new for-profit lifestyle website to make a big difference in the lives of tens of millions of children. This sounds ambitious! Daniel Burnham, the great Chicago architect, said \\\"Make no little plans; they have not the power to stir men&rsquo;s souls.\\\" (Nor women&rsquo;s, we hasten to add). Little plans also do not have the power to provide a better education to 56 million kids who deserve more than they are getting today. We face a crushing need in schools, have a solid plan to address it, and with your help, we intend to grow this very large and very fast. This sounds much better than the usual cookie dough sales from so many schools. ClassWish.org is the new solution for school fundraising so every teacher can get the classroom supplies (s)he needs. Where are you located? Right in Manhattan, across from Madison Square Garden, within one block of four express subway stops, PATH, LIRR, and NJ Transit. We will also hire interns to work remotely from other cities. What skills and experience are you looking for? We seek a wide range of skills: research, social media, outreach, and marketing. Tell us what you&rsquo;ve got. I looked at the two websites and have some suggestions. Great! This is a collaborative project, and we want to hear from you. Your ClassWish review and Have to Have review will be helpful. Is this a paid internship? We can offer a great experience, a great addition to your r\u00e9sum\u00e9, academic credit (if your school allows), stunning recommendations, and a chance to make a difference, but we are a start-up nonprofit, so can only offer unpaid internship and volunteer positions. When will you select the interns? We&rsquo;re agile. When we see a great candidate, we extend an invitation immediately. We won&rsquo;t keep you waiting for a decision. What dates will the internship run? We are hiring for the summer, for the fall semester, and beyond. Tell us what you are looking for. What are the hours? We welcome full-time and part-time interns. Let us know what works for you. What will I need to bring? Brains, heart, passion, energy, and passion. We also need you to bring your own notebook computer. As a small start-up, we just cannot afford to buy dozens of machines. Sounds exciting! How can I apply?

RSVP for our Information Session for Video Professionals! (See RSVP details below!) Our goal is to put together a volunteer team that can edit the groundbreaking work being done at The Actors Theatre Workshop. Using your professional skills to edit this wonderful material will surely stimulate hope, excitement and I believe bring true enlightenment to those who participate. At the same time you will reach another dimension in your craft as you learn about the unique filming/editing perspective of the ATW Founder and Artistic Director, Thurman E. Scott. ATW has long been on the front lines of disciplined creative training for theater professionals and individuals committed to fulfilling their creative potential. ATW has also been a safe haven for thousands of at-risk and homeless youth. The original theater and educational technique which has been tremendously successful with our professional acting students, has proven to be equally beneficial to the children we teach in our after-school programs. We have many years of footage from our adult acting workshop's and community program's that we want to share with you and the world. We've started sharing this video online and we've received such positive feedback from every corner of the globe that we are taking steps to put out more. This process takes time and so we would like to find more dedicated individuals who want to learn and make a difference in other people's lives and be a part of something hopeful by joining our video editing team. Our editors often talk about the beautiful, inspiring and deeply moving moments they have witnessed when a student actor or a child from a homeless shelter brings forth his talent and reaches for their potential. You literally see the moments when there is a shift in consciousness and they begin to accept their strength and the unique gifts that they have to offer the world. And in that moment you know that this person has changed forever-- and as a result undoubtedly so have you. By working directly with this material you will gain deep insight into the emotional and psychological breakdown of drama, and learn to see the penetrating insights that come out of script analysis, which gives you the ability to find and understand the eternal essence of ideas that are then formulated into a universal idea that helps to instill faith and spread hope to all individuals on a creative journey. So without further ado.. We invite you to a Volunteer Info Session for video editing professionals .To RSVP go to: http://www.actorstheatreworkshop.com, click on \\\"volunteers\\\" and fill out an online application. We will contact you to set up an Information and Interview Session. At the Info Session you'll have a chance to meet leaders in the organization, learn about the work ATW has done in the community and see some of the inspiring videos that have already been cut.

This is an intensive Leadership Training Program in non-profit business management. Interns receive hands-on training as a management assistant. If skilled in video, interns may assist in video production and editing at our award-winning theater arts and community service organization. As video production becomes increasingly critical to the growth, development and success of managing a successful non-profit, we seek intern candidates that are leaders who are passionate about non-profit management and posses skills in video production and editing. Successful non-profits are built on powerful ideas that inspire hope. These ideas are manifested in the programs and the management of the organization. By gaining a working understanding of how to successfully manage a nonprofit organization, the intern begins to learn its core principals, which allows the intern to begin to take a leadership role in the organization. In addition, this knowledge is invaluable in the creation of videos that effectively promote and bring this work to the world. These videos are essential to the marketing and fund-raising efforts in any successful non-profit. We are looking for individuals with the ability to lead, manage teams, work independently, communicate effectively on the phone, in person and in writing and interact in a fast-paced business environment. We are looking for idealists and leaders who can put their thoughts and insights into action; positive, enthusiastic individuals who want to make a difference in the world and are committed to upholding the legacy and tradition of theater in the belief that theater can change a life and make the world a better place for everyone. The interns' primary responsibility is to manage the daily administrative operations of the organization and to take a leadership role in programming initiatives. There will be opportunities to work closely with the senior staff: in administrating over workshops for actors and community programs that serve Youth-at-Risk and homeless children. Under ATW supervision, interns will be accountable for projects in the management of ATW's studio rental business, administration, team management, marketing, development, sales, fund-raising, video production, event planning, and graphic design. For international applicants, English proficiency is required. In addition, Interns may also work on a combination of logging, editing, and production of on-going video projects that depend on ATW's current schedule and on the intern's skill level. Interns will work under the direction of a project manager. We seek applicants with training and experience logging footage, editing in Final Cut Pro, http streaming, digital shooting, lighting, sound and web design and development. Interns and Volunteers consistently report they gain tremendously from filming and reviewing footage of ATW classes and workshops and have benefited as if they had actually taken the classes themselves. In summary, we seek professional, detail-oriented individuals who are positive and curious, with a desire to learn and engage in a process. The Actors Theatre Workshop is an award-winning non-profit theater, educational institution and community center in NYC founded by award-winning actor, director, writer and producer, Thurman E.

BRC helps these neediest New Yorkers overcome the challenges of addiction, physical and mental illness, and poverty, and improves life in the community.

Outreach staff and volunteers engages homeless individuals with the goal of assessing each individual's situation and needs and providing each client with an accessible doorway to services they need. Clients are afforded referral, transportation and placement at the resource deemed most beneficial to the individual, and each is treated with respect, professionalism and informed guidance. The Outreach Team encounters many individuals that are reluctant to use services or have found the available resources unmanageable and overwhelming. These clients are provided with counseling, information and advocacy in pursuing services, rights and resources. Every individual engaged is given the opportunity to access the services most suited to their needs.

Our M4MH workshop is a 2-hour interactive workshop on college campuses that creates space for students to have open and honest conversations about mental health. They involve interactive discussion, watching and responding to short films about different mental health issues, and a panel of speakers talking about lived experience stories, and mental health resources available to students on-campus and in the community. The workshops are incredibly powerful, eye-opening, and inspiring, as it&rsquo;s not often that we get to truly talk about these complex issues. The vast majority of students who attend report that the workshop increased awareness of mental health issues, reduced stigma around mental illness, and increased their likelihood to seek mental health support if they need it. Workshop Support Volunteers Our Workshop Support Volunteers (that&rsquo;s you!) are an incredibly important aspect of our work. The workshop will be led by one of our facilitators, and they can&rsquo;t do it alone! They will be setting up and leading the workshop, and there are a lot of moving parts involved. Your tasks as a Workshop Support Volunteer could include: Having a phone call with AWI&rsquo;s Program Director to discuss the details of volunteering, and to learn more about AWI and the M4MH workshop Checking in with the AWI Workshop Facilitator a few days prior to the event over the phone to go over the day-of details Arriving at the workshop one hour before the event starts Assisting with the setup of the AWI table of resources Passing out and collecting pre- and post-workshop surveys Typing into the Powerpoint while the facilitator is running the workshop Taking photos throughout the workshop After the workshop, representing AWI at the resource table, chatting with students about AWI, and helping with any logistical clean-up before leaving the event If there are multiple volunteers, you will not need to do all of these tasks, so don&rsquo;t worry if there&rsquo;s anything in that list that you wouldn&rsquo;t want to do.

Our nonprofit focuses on news about making the world a better place, particularly news related to topics such as global poverty, nonprofits, climate change and human rights. All volunteering is via the computer -- you can be anywhere in the world. The Daily Source is truly a 21st century journalism site. Our online software is incredibly easy to use and automates most of the layout process. Just drag and drop articles from one location to another and the page adjusts itself automatically. Editing the headlines is as easy as using Microsoft Word or sending an e-mail. You will receive guidance from our senior editors who are some of the top newspaper journalists in the U.S. Besides laying out the front page, you will find articles, videos, columns and other material from around the Internet for use on the site and make the final decision of what goes on the site. You will be doing real stuff that directly impacts our front page and our nonprofit's mission to help the world. You will also gain invaluable experience that will build your skills and look great on a resume. Some of our volunteers have gone on to work in the journalism field. Two of our volunteers started their own non-profit organization after eight months of volunteering with us. One of our editors was hired full-time by Wired.com and another was hired by Congress as the official congressional photographer of senators at public events. We have an extensive training process that is about a month long, so if we are going to train you, we need you to do a certain amount of hours in all to make it worth the time we put into it. Therefore, the Front Page Editor role is a minimum of 15 hours per week for a minimum of six months. If you can volunteer 20 hours or higher a week, then the minimum is only five months, or you can do 12 hours a week for seven and a half months. We tend to give preference to applicants who can do a sizable number of hours. All editors are credited at the bottom of the site each day, and daily editions are archived so your friends, family and future employers will see what you were part of creating. To view our front page, visit - http://dailysource.org/ To read more about us, view the links here - http://dailysource.org/about/site We usually also have the following openings (minimum hours per week and minimum number of months are in parenthesis). All these positions are telecommute so you don&rsquo;t have to drive or dress up, and can work from the comfort of your home. You might also be able to use our local Internet location, though there is some cost for that so virtual is preferred. If you apply for a position, you should view your commitment to it the same as if it were a paid position. We treat volunteers like normal staff and rely on them like staff. Our site is 99% volunteer run and we all depend on each other to make it a success. Please do not apply if you are viewing this opportunity as \\\"just a volunteer position\\\" and would treat it as less important than paid positions or other commitments you have. If you are in school, volunteering with us can function as an internship. Interns can usually receive credit with their school for their internships. Content Editor (10 hours a week for a minimum of 6 months): Searches the Internet for high quality articles, columns, editorials and videos, adds them to our system, and ranks them by quality. The front page editors pick from these to publish on the front page. Also does research and fact-checking when needed. This requires Internet surfing skills, strong understanding and judgment of the news, and attention to detail. Marketing and Social Media (6 hours a week for a minimum of 5 months): Help research potential media outlets and blogs to cover our site, e-mail our press releases to them, and keep track of coverage of our site that has occurred. We have a great website and need to get the word out about it. Help promote the website by updating our Facebook, Twitter and other social media pages, attracting new followers, and interacting with our existing followers.

We tend to give preference to people who can do more hours. * A description of your past work/volunteer experience and education, or a resume or a link to a LinkedIn profile.

The Comprehensive Community Hospice Program of Parker Jewish Institute is looking for people who would like to volunteer as a doula, going out to patients' homes and extending the hand of reassurance, offering a smile that warms the heart, and the words that say everything will be okay. Volunteer Doulas will help patients and families cope with the process of dying, remaining at the bedside as life ends. \\\"Doula\\\" is a Greek word that means \\\"woman servant or caregiver.\\\" Today it is associated with individuals who provide physical assistance and emotional support during and/or after childbirth. This proposed program aims to mirror the concept by providing the same type of support at the final phase of a terminal illness. This initiative will place a focus on planning for death with the elderly patient and family if there is one, and will provide a continuous around the clock vigil as death becomes imminent. The program will help the elderly patient who lacks family or adequate caregiver support to die comfortably, without fear of being alone. Even when surrounded by loved ones, individuals with a terminal illness and those closest to them may feel isolated as they face the end of life. As the end of life approaches, patients and families struggle with anxiety and fear; exhaustion; loved ones often feel alone, unprepared and afraid; and opportunities to explore meaning go unaddressed. Hospice Doulas provide emotional support and comfort to patients and their loved ones in the final phase of a terminal illness. Our End-of-Life (EOL) Doula volunteers will receive thorough training in understanding the dying process and in the skills that help bring peace and comfort to all involved. This free two-day training includes learning how to do guided visualization, help create rituals, provide simple physical support, offer sacred presence, as well as how to create spiritual and emotional legacies. Parker Jewish institute will be hosting a free two-day Doula training workshop on Saturday 10/28/17 and Sunday 10/29/17 from 9:00am-6:00pm. Breakfast and lunch will be served. A certificate will be awarded upon completion of this workshop. If you are interested in attending, please call the Hospice Program's Volunteer Doula Coordinator at 718-289-2134, or email volunteer-nerken@parkerinstitute.org. Doulas can come from any background and no experience is required. They typically work in as part of a team. They usually sit quietly with a patient, talk with them and offer support, comfort and companionship.

In 2012, Cathedral High School was ranked by The New York Observer as one of New York City&rsquo;s top 160 schools and among the top 35 private high schools. Almost all of our students are daughters of immigrant working families. 645 young women representing 72 countries attend CHS. Many of our students come from families who earn at or below the federal poverty level (60% of students are eligible for free or reduced lunch). Over 82% of our girls are Hispanic or of African American descent. Through the decades, CHS has continued to enhance its academic curriculum and extra-curricular activities to ensure that students graduate equipped with the skills necessary to be successful in college and careers thereafter.
