Here is an opportunity to help underprivileged children, to help under-served children, to help ALL children, and to help adults who can't read. You can be a part of an amazing convergence of forces that is about to change the literacy paradigm in the United States. Two years ago, the Barbara Bush Foundation and Dollar General sponsored the $7million XPrize for Adult Literacy to incent teams from around the world to develop solutions to the literacy crisis in America. The parameters of the contest were that teams had to build an app that would teach reading to illiterate and low literate adults without any one on one assistance from another adult. The American Youth Literacy Foundation (dba Youth Lit and YouthLit.org) joined this competition in an effort to convert our patented reading curriculum that we had been using for 8 years to teach thousands of children how to read, into a digital app. Unfortunately we had to withdraw from that competition; but our efforts and desire to complete our children's literacy app have only been strengthened by the experience. The XPrize app competition allowed us to see the future. Although the contest was geared towards adults, we could imagine the potential of a children's reading app that could teach children how to read with minimal (or even without any) adult participation. Today we are further along than ever in the creation of this amazing new technology. We are literally only a few months away from completing the beta version of the app. We are testing it in real world environments with real kids who are learning how to read. Based on this critical feedback, we are preparing to take our app from beta to V 1.0, (probably an 18-24 month endeavor) and will ultimately make the app available for FREE global distribution through the Apple store and Google. Now we are looking for multiple creative people to help with the completion of this project. We need graphic designers who have a keen sense of layout and design, who are skilled in Adobe CS (especially Illustrator). We need people who are willing to learn an easy rapid prototyping app development tool called Ionic Creator. Some java script experience or other coding experience may help but isn't essential. We need anyone willing to test the beta with children as we continue to build it. If you are a former teacher or educator, or have contacts in that field it would be helpful. If you are a UX or UI person and want real world experience building an app, we can use your help. Because we are using a rapid prototyping tool that is essentially drag and drop, we do not need wireframing. And because we are converting our own proprietary curriculum to a digital format, we do not need to recreate the wheel about how to teach reading to children. Nonetheless, there is ample opportunity to apply UX/UI skills to the continued development of the app. If you are interested in fundraising or the social (not necessarily social media) side of things, we need people who can write letters, build a fundraising program, recruit partners, communicate with potential donors, etc. You can make a huge difference in helping us solve the literacy crisis by joining our team. This has been and will continue to be an incredibly exciting and rewarding experience for a small group of people. If this is something that you feel passionate about and want to get involved in, then please reply today. We need your help. Your contribution in the development of this app, could make a difference in literally, millions of lives. Thank you! We truly look forward to hearing from you : ) Please provide cover letter and resume (or link to an online portfolio) for this opportunity and we will contact you directly.

It's easy for you to get involved and help save more animals simply by driving a leg in this relay. How it works: Click the I WANT TO HELP button. When an animal rescue organization posts a transport request, we will search to see if it matches your profile (if you're available and within the distance) and then send you an e-mail. Then you simply click on the leg that you can cover and everyone else will see that you've signed up for that leg. You'll get communications from the transport coordinator and, once the transport is a \\\"go\\\", you simply drive to the meeting place, load up the animals, and drive them to the next meeting place to hand them off to the next volunteer. You'll get plenty of doggy kisses and thank you's along the way as the animals know you are there to help them.

Here is an opportunity to help underprivileged children, to help under-served children, to help ALL children, and to help adults who can't read. You can be a part of an amazing convergence of forces that is about to change the literacy paradigm in the United States. Two years ago, the Barbara Bush Foundation and Dollar General sponsored the $7million XPrize for Adult Literacy to incent teams from around the world to develop solutions to the literacy crisis in America. The parameters of the contest were that teams had to build an app that would teach reading to illiterate and low literate adults without any one on one assistance from another adult. The American Youth Literacy Foundation (dba Youth Lit and YouthLit.org) joined this competition in an effort to convert our patented reading curriculum that we had been using for 8 years to teach thousands of children how to read, into a digital app. Unfortunately we had to withdraw from that competition; but our efforts and desire to complete our children's literacy app have only been strengthened by the experience. The XPrize app competition allowed us to see the future. Although the contest was geared towards adults, we could imagine the potential of a children's reading app that could teach children how to read with minimal (or even without any) adult participation. Today we are further along than ever in the creation of this amazing new technology. We are literally only a few months away from completing the beta version of the app. We are testing it in real world environments with real kids who are learning how to read. Based on this critical feedback, we are preparing to take our app from beta to V 1.0, (probably an 18-24 month endeavor) and will ultimately make the app available for FREE global distribution through the Apple store and Google. Now we are looking for multiple creative people to help with the completion of this project. We need graphic designers who have a keen sense of layout and design, who are skilled in Adobe CS (especially Illustrator). We need people who are willing to learn an easy rapid prototyping app development tool called Ionic Creator. Some java script experience or other coding experience may help but isn't essential. We need anyone willing to test the beta with children as we continue to build it. If you are a former teacher or educator, or have contacts in that field it would be helpful. If you are a UX or UI person and want real world experience building an app, we can use your help. Because we are using a rapid prototyping tool that is essentially drag and drop, we do not need wireframing. And because we are converting our own proprietary curriculum to a digital format, we do not need to recreate the wheel about how to teach reading to children. Nonetheless, there is ample opportunity to apply UX/UI skills to the continued development of the app. If you are interested in fundraising or the social (not necessarily social media) side of things, we need people who can write letters, build a fundraising program, recruit partners, communicate with potential donors, etc. You can make a huge difference in helping us solve the literacy crisis by joining our team. This has been and will continue to be an incredibly exciting and rewarding experience for a small group of people. If this is something that you feel passionate about and want to get involved in, then please reply today. We need your help. Your contribution in the development of this app, could make a difference in literally, millions of lives. Thank you! We truly look forward to hearing from you : ) Please provide cover letter and resume (or link to an online portfolio) for this opportunity and we will contact you directly.

Sprout is a non-profit organization based in New York City focused on providing innovative programs for adults with developmental disabilities.With our network of resources and dedicated volunteers, which we call leaders, Sprout opens up fascinating new worlds to people with disabilities. Sprout's Overnight Vacations Program is looking for individuals who have the energy, motivation and desire to work with adults with developmental disabilities. What do Sprout leaders do? Sprout leaders' primary goal is to give adults with developmental disabilities the opportunity to experience and enjoy recreational, educational and leisure activities through overnight vacations. Leaders are responsible for the overall safety and enjoyment of their group, 24 hours a day, while on a Sprout trip. Duties include safety monitoring, personal hygiene assistance, providing physical and emotional support, activity planning, budgeting, logistics, and enhancing fun. The work is hard yet immensely rewarding as you develop leadership skills and gain insight into your own abilities. What type of training is provided? Leaders must complete a pre-service training, which provides the necessary procedures and tools to run a successful and enjoyable vacation. Leaders who are drivers receive extra training on how to safely drive our 15-passenger vans. In addition, all leaders receive a copy of Sprout's Leadership Handbook to help with policies and guidelines. What is the time commitment? Sprout vacations last 3 - 7 days depending on the time of year and destination of the trip. When a leader is selected for an overnight vacation, Sprout asks that the leader dedicate themselves to stay with their group throughout the entire duration of the vacation. Some leaders only choose to lead one trip a year while others spend several months with us leading up to 8 trips or more. Sprout strives to make our program flexible for our leaders based on the amount of time leaders can give. Do leaders have any free or personal time while on a trip? Sprout trips are working vacations for the leaders who choose to participate. Because Sprout leaders are responsible for their group 24 hours a day, there is no free or personal time allotted. In order to give our participants the opportunity to experience and enjoy a vacation, Sprout leaders must be available at all times to provide the support any one participant may need. What type of trips can Sprout leaders expect to join? A majority of Sprout trips take place within a day's drive of New York City. Destinations include Atlantic City, Amish Country, Boston, Lake George, Cleveland, Maine and Virginia Beach. Exotic trips like cruises, Hawaii, and Europe are presented to leaders who have demonstrated high levels of commitment, service hours and have gained positive feedback from participants and Sprout office staff. Are there any special skills or requirements? No special background or education is required to become a Sprout leader. We encourage people from all cultures and professions, and of all ethnic and educational backgrounds. Once accepted into the program, you will receive the necessary tools to sign up for outings and how to assist our participants. Requirements include: -21+ years old -Provide references -Participate in training session -Willingness to complete necessary background checks -Evaluate participants' behavior -Fluent English -Willing to drive a 15 passenger van -Love to travel & have fun!

It's easy for you to get involved and help save more animals simply by driving a leg in this relay. How it works: Click the I WANT TO HELP button.

Then you simply click on the leg that you can cover and everyone else will see that you've signed up for that leg. You'll get communications from the transport coordinator and, once the transport is a \\\"go\\\", you simply drive to the meeting place, load up the animals, and drive them to the next meeting place to hand them off to the next volunteer. You'll get plenty of doggy kisses and thank you's along the way as the animals know you are there to help them.

Hospice volunteers enhance the quality of life and help reduce the burden for family caregivers by providing support, assistance, in patient&rsquo;s homes, in nursing homes, and assisted living facilities. To be a volunteer, there is no special requirement other than a sincere desire to help people and the ability to listen.

Hospice volunteers can commit to as little or as much time as they wish. Some volunteers provide several hours of service each week while others commit to a few hours each month. Serving as valued members of the hospice team, for just a few hours of your time you can make a significant impact on the lives of patients and their loved ones.

Whether the Music Volunteer is sharing an existing musical skill or playing music via the radio or digital device, the goal is to enhance the quality of life of our patients. Often, regularly scheduled visits are requested, however Music Volunteers may also be asked to provide musical visits on an occasional basis for one patient/family or for a group of patients at a facility as outreach for the local hospice agency. Hospice is built on the philosophy that we care for our patients in mind, body and soul. Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, memory bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network. They often make phone calls to check up on family members and also send cards of comfort and care.

BACKGROUND In addition to outstanding parent volunteers, our Little League has had a lot of success with non-parent volunteers, including several who currently serve on our league's Board of Directors. Consequently, we're always looking for volunteer softball coaches, particularly those who with experience playing or coaching sports at the college level and beyond. Currently, we have an emphasis and focus on finding more female softball coaches who can coach and serve as role models for the girls in our program. We firmly believe that this plays a critical role in impacting the perceptions and future aspirations of our girls and how they see and understand leadership in the world. Over the long term, we aspire to achieve at least a 50-50 gender split of coaches. Some of the material that serves as our inspiration are below: Sports Coaching Is Still A Male Dominated Field by The Atlantic, Jul 27, 2017 - https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/535167/ Where Are the Women by NCAA Champion Magazine - http://www.ncaa.org/static/champion/where-are-the-women/ Why More Women Coaches Are Needed by WeCoach - https://wecoachsports.org/ Declining Rates of Female Youth Coaches by Aspen Institute 2018 - https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/10-charts-that-show-progress-challenges-to-fix-youth-sports/ COMMITMENT Games and practices are generally Friday (after work hours), Saturday, or Sunday. Times vary by season and age but commitment is about 1 to 3 hours a week. We're flexible and more than happy to work with you to find the right role in our program depending on your schedule and availability.

We are a hospice agency serving the terminally ill throughout New Jersey. Many of our patients have Alzheimer&rsquo;s or Dementia, which are debilitating diseases of memory loss. Most of them have lost their short term memory and can no longer recognize their families, friends and surroundings; but their long term memory consisting of their childhood or years past can remain intact. Therefore, we create Memory Books, in which we categorize items such as food, holidays, sports, cars, flowers/gardens, people, people showing emotion such as hugs, etc. Volunteers create these books by finding and cutting out pictures or scenes from magazines, cards, calendars, etc. We sit with the patients and review these categories to see if any memory is stimulated and many times it is. We have had great results with this over the years as a tool for the mental stimulation for these patients. It takes a lot of time, hours and dedication to put these books together and a great deal of material is needed to complete them. This is truly a community project that touches and adds to the quality of life for our patients. Grace Healthcare Services is happy to provide all materials needed to make these books.

Volunteer Musicians play one song per room and interact with patients, their families and hospital staff. All lyrics MUST be appropriate for a hospital setting, therefore MOC provides an approved song list for musicians to select their repertoire for hospital visits. Any other material outside of the approved song list may be submitted to MOC staff for approval. Musician applicants must also submit a sample of their music prior to acceptance into the program. Volunteer Musicians must complete MOC's training process which is outlined below. Guides Volunteer Guides escort Volunteer Musicians from room to room as they play music for patients. Volunteer Guides knock on each hospital room door and ask patients if they feel like hearing music. They also introduce the musicians prior to their performances and guide them through the facility. Each guide is assigned to a specific healthcare facility. The Volunteer Guide is the \\\"eyes and ears\\\" of MOC during the Bedside Performance Program as well as the liaison between the hospital and the Volunteer Musician. But most importantly, Volunteer Guides know the protocols, policies and expectations of the hospitals or healthcare facilities in which they volunteer and are responsible for making sure these guidelines are upheld during the program. Volunteer Guides are critical to the success of the program.

WHAT WE'LL BE DOING: When you come to the Story Love night, a Story Pirate will do a brief introduction, go over the process for writing thoughtful and positive comments on each story, and facilitate discussion as your group reads the funny, touching, heartwarming, and sometimes heart-wrenching stories that kids write. At the end of the evening, you will have provided young people with the affirmation they need to call themselves writers-and you'll have shared some laughs, and maybe tears, from the stories. Story Love evenings are entertaining and productive. WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW: Story Pirates has been providing arts education-and giving Story Love-since 2003. This is your chance to lend a hand to a budding writer. Who knows what future talent you may uncover or who you may encourage and inspire to keep exploring the world through writing. WHERE TO MEET: We will be meeting at the Upright Citizens Brigade offices at 520 8th Avenue. When you arrive at the building, you'll have to show your ID and then head to the 9th floor. STORY PIRATES: Story Pirates (www.storypirates.org) is a nationally respected arts and creative writing organization that celebrates the words and ideas of young people, promotes literacy as a vital part of early childhood education, and preserves the spark of youthful creativity often lost in the transition to adulthood. Story Pirates does this by going in to New York City schools and providing arts education!

It is with this mission that we recognized the opportunity over 16 years ago to start a Free Tax Prep Program program for the underserved Brooklyn residents. As Brooklyn&rsquo;s largest noncommercial tax provider, we have grown to cover most of central Brooklyn along with southern Brooklyn. This is, in large part, thanks to our volunteer tax preparers. Volunteer Tax Preparers will be tasked with completing high quality tax returns for low- and middle-income Brooklynites. Our ideal tax preparer would have a high interest and motivation for building on their tax preparation experience. They should also have a passion for helping the members of our community who need it most. Most of all, our volunteers should be able to practice patience, good customer service skills, and have a great sense of humor! This is a great opportunity to build valuable work experience, meet new friends, and help people who need it. Benefits Wide ranging benefits include learning new skills or building on valuable professional experience with active work duties. We have served as professional references for many of our volunteers. CPAs, Attorneys, and Enrolled Agents also receive Continuing Education Credits upon completion of volunteer service in this program. Build a sense of achievement for directly positively affecting your fellow Brooklynites by providing them with top quality tax service without the predatory service fees associated with retail tax providers. If that isn&rsquo;t enough for you to sign up, we&rsquo;ll also provide snacks. General Requirements All volunteers are welcome! If you don't have any tax experience, no problem! We provide training. Training All tax preparers must pass the IRS Volunteer Basic Certification via the Link and Learn training module online. Advanced Certification is also welcome.

Our nonprofit focuses on news about making the world a better place, particularly news related to topics such as global poverty, nonprofits, climate change and human rights. All volunteering is via the computer -- you can be anywhere in the world. The Daily Source is truly a 21st century journalism site. Our online software is incredibly easy to use and automates most of the layout process. Just drag and drop articles from one location to another and the page adjusts itself automatically. Editing the headlines is as easy as using Microsoft Word or sending an e-mail. You will receive guidance from our senior editors who are some of the top newspaper journalists in the U.S. Besides laying out the front page, you will find articles, videos, columns and other material from around the Internet for use on the site and make the final decision of what goes on the site. You will be doing real stuff that directly impacts our front page and our nonprofit's mission to help the world. You will also gain invaluable experience that will build your skills and look great on a resume. Some of our volunteers have gone on to work in the journalism field. Two of our volunteers started their own non-profit organization after eight months of volunteering with us. One of our editors was hired full-time by Wired.com and another was hired by Congress as the official congressional photographer of senators at public events. We have an extensive training process that is about a month long, so if we are going to train you, we need you to do a certain amount of hours in all to make it worth the time we put into it. Therefore, the Front Page Editor role is a minimum of 15 hours per week for a minimum of six months. If you can volunteer 20 hours or higher a week, then the minimum is only five months, or you can do 12 hours a week for seven and a half months. We tend to give preference to applicants who can do a sizable number of hours. All editors are credited at the bottom of the site each day, and daily editions are archived so your friends, family and future employers will see what you were part of creating. To view our front page, visit - http://dailysource.org/ To read more about us, view the links here - http://dailysource.org/about/site We usually also have the following openings (minimum hours per week and minimum number of months are in parenthesis). All these positions are telecommute so you don&rsquo;t have to drive or dress up, and can work from the comfort of your home. You might also be able to use our local Internet location, though there is some cost for that so virtual is preferred. If you apply for a position, you should view your commitment to it the same as if it were a paid position. We treat volunteers like normal staff and rely on them like staff.

We welcome your gifts of time and compassion. Whether you choose to work directly with patients and families or to volunteer in one of many other ways, you can make a profound difference in someone's life, including your own. Volunteers are an integral part of the hospice team. Volunteers are needed in all areas of NJ! Volunteer Opportunities: Companionship Volunteers work directly with patients providing companionship, offering friendly visits, reading to patients, writing letters, offering a gentle touch or sharing a quiet moment. Complementary Volunteers are certified/trained professionals who can provide complementary modalities of reflexology, music, imagery and touch therapies such as Reiki, massage, therapeutic touch and healing hands. Pet Therapy Volunteers provide certified/trained pets who visit with patients. These animals provide loving memories for some and give unconditional love helping our patients feel connected to a larger world. Administrative Volunteers provide help to the staff in our Edison office by assisting with typing, addressing cards, organizing newsletters, creating packets, collating manuals and other varied clerical duties Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, huggable dolls/bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Junior Volunteers consist of groups such as girl/boy scouts or young people who wish to honor our patients by making holiday cards, posters, wall hangings and memory books. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families and friends of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network. Hospice training classes are required for Companionship and Complementary Volunteers. They are free of charge and offered on an ongoing basis.

You will be doing real stuff that directly impacts our front page and our nonprofit's mission to help the world. You will also gain invaluable experience that will build your skills and look great on a resume. Some of our volunteers have gone on to work in the journalism field. Two of our volunteers started their own non-profit organization after eight months of volunteering with us. One of our editors was hired full-time by Wired.com and another was hired by Congress as the official congressional photographer of senators at public events. We have an extensive training process that is about a month long, so if we are going to train you, we need you to do a certain amount of hours in all to make it worth the time we put into it. Therefore, the Front Page Editor role is a minimum of 15 hours per week for a minimum of six months. If you can volunteer 20 hours or higher a week, then the minimum is only five months, or you can do 12 hours a week for seven and a half months. We tend to give preference to applicants who can do a sizable number of hours. All editors are credited at the bottom of the site each day, and daily editions are archived so your friends, family and future employers will see what you were part of creating. To view our front page, visit - http://dailysource.org/ To read more about us, view the links here - http://dailysource.org/about/site We usually also have the following openings (minimum hours per week and minimum number of months are in parenthesis). All these positions are telecommute so you don&rsquo;t have to drive or dress up, and can work from the comfort of your home. You might also be able to use our local Internet location, though there is some cost for that so virtual is preferred. If you apply for a position, you should view your commitment to it the same as if it were a paid position. We treat volunteers like normal staff and rely on them like staff. Our site is 99% volunteer run and we all depend on each other to make it a success. Please do not apply if you are viewing this opportunity as \\\"just a volunteer position\\\" and would treat it as less important than paid positions or other commitments you have. If you are in school, volunteering with us can function as an internship. Interns can usually receive credit with their school for their internships. Content Editor (10 hours a week for a minimum of 6 months): Searches the Internet for high quality articles, columns, editorials and videos, adds them to our system, and ranks them by quality. The front page editors pick from these to publish on the front page. Also does research and fact-checking when needed. This requires Internet surfing skills, strong understanding and judgment of the news, and attention to detail. Marketing and Social Media (6 hours a week for a minimum of 5 months): Help research potential media outlets and blogs to cover our site, e-mail our press releases to them, and keep track of coverage of our site that has occurred. We have a great website and need to get the word out about it. Help promote the website by updating our Facebook, Twitter and other social media pages, attracting new followers, and interacting with our existing followers. No marketing experience required, but you must be familiar with social media and be good at communicating. If you're interested in volunteering, please email us at volunteer@dailysource.org and let us know: * Which position or positions are you interested in? * How many hours per week and how many months can you do? We tend to give preference to people who can do more hours. * A description of your past work/volunteer experience and education, or a resume or a link to a LinkedIn profile. You can also apply directly through this website by clicking the button for that, and giving us the same information. Sometimes emails sent through this volunteer website are routed to spam folders, so we recommend you check your spam folder during the coming weeks in case our reply to you ends up there.

This opportunity is particularly geared towards graphic designers that are either looking to gain more experience or are experienced and have enough extra time on their hands that they would like to contribute to achieving the mission of our organization. In any case, my philosophy in regards to soliciting volunteer contribution is that the arrangement that we ultimately agree upon should be mutually beneficial for everyone involved. In other words, my number one priority in building a working relationship with you is ensuring that you are not exploited and that you gain actual value and professional growth from this experience. Especially if you're a student or a new graphic designer. So that being said, under this opportunity, you will operate as an official member of The Eyes Like Mine Marketing Team. You will not be the only graphic designer on the team. We will be recruiting at least 3-5 so that everyone can contribute at a pace reasonable for someone that is not being paid anything and not be overtaxed. In your role as a member of the team, you will typically be directed by me to design flyers, brochures, social media graphics, website graphics, and other marketing collateral on an as needed basis for Eyes Like Mine initiatives. I will do my best to structure the workflow of the team in a manner that gives you at least two weeks notice if not a month's advanced notice for any specific job requests. Our primary method of communication will be a monthly team phone call and email. Our goals at the time of this writing are to prepare a marketing plan for 2017 and line up what campaigns we will be putting into play to build brand awareness and broaden our audience.

Each child is matched with a volunteer who meets with them each visit to share stories, creating a more enduring bond than is possible in the Reading Parties. The continuity of RBP offers a child the opportunity to not only improve their reading skills and open up their imagination, but more importantly it gives them the chance to deepen the bonds and their sense of trust with one person. As their friendships with the children evolve, volunteers can better help the children in this program to see their world in a more positive light. And, in talking about the stories the share, the children can learn to use their imaginations to make a difference in their own lives. http://pajamaprogram.org/ Requirements and Commitments: ALL volunteers must pass a background check and fill out a volunteer application to be able to participate in Reading Buddy Plus. All personal information will be kept confidential. This program runs every other Monday & Tuesday from 11 A.M. - 12 P.M. from October-June.

Meetings are an hour or two, and usually consist of skill-building and badge earning activities. Leaders also communicate with troop parents and their local Girl Scout support team for any help they might need. How much time will this take? It's up to you! You decide how many times your troop meets. The time you give as a troop leader is valuable to us, and we'll give you tools that let you make the most of it.

Girl Scouts Heart of New Jersey is looking for bilingual volunteers who want to help grow Girl Scouts in the city of Elizabeth. The Bilingual Champion will work to recruit new Hispanic girls and volunteers by hosting tables at community events, hosting recruitment events and/or building relationships within the community. Why is Girl Scouts good for Latinas? Studies by the Girl Scout Research Institute show that the leadership aspirations of Latina girls are striking: 66% of Latinas aspire to be leaders. But what is even more impressive is the kind of leader Latinas want to be. The same studies show that the main barrier getting in their way is low confidence and self-regard. The Girl Scout experience gives every girl the confidence and personal leadership skills she needs to realize her full potential. Girl Scouts are more successful in school, relationships, and careers; and they achieve more for their families, their community, and their country than non-Girl Scouts. By bringing together girls from different cultures, Girl Scouts gives them a place to celebrate their own heritage and learn about others&rsquo;, which creates a sense of pride and understanding. Both qualities-pride and understanding-serve girls well throughout their lives.

Each year, the Guide Dog Foundation breeds about 300 exceptional puppies, and it's vital that Bosley and other pups like him spend the first year of their lives with surrounded by the love and security of volunteer foster families called puppy walkers. Puppy walkers help Foundation puppies grow up to be confident dogs. What's involved in raising a Guide Dog Foundation puppy? Bosley went to live with his puppy walkers when he was about nine weeks old. He's learning basic obedience and social skills while being exposed to many different situations. People who raise Guide Dog Foundation puppies say it is the most rewarding thing they've ever done. Puppy raisers come from everywhere - stay-at-home moms or dads, teachers, college students, retirees, people with flexible work environments - and are crucial members of the Guide Dog Foundation family. By opening their hearts and homes to a puppy, a puppy raiser plays a crucial role in helping a person with disabilities live an independent life. Every puppy walker family works with a Guide Dog Foundation puppy adviser, who is available to answer questions and offer guidance and support. When he is about 14 months old, Bosley will return to the Guide Dog Foundation's Smithtown campus to begin his training as a guide or service dog. Puppy raisers will admit it's tough to say good-bye, but when they see the pup they raised take its place at the side of someone with disabilities, the ache they feel turns pride. There are puppies waiting now to join your loving home for a chance to start their careers.

For over 60 years, the Guide Dog Foundation for the Blind has provided guide and service dogs and training free of charge to people with disabilities who seek the enhanced mobility, independence, and companionship only an assistance dog can provide.", "title": "Must Love Dogs in Nassau County!

Grace Healthcare Services is a Hospice organization that cares for patients throughout NJ. Veterans at the end of life. Volunteers are an essential component of this care. WHY A NEED FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS? -Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect to patients who have served our country. -Veterans share a common bond and code of conduct. -The camaraderie that exists between Veterans has proven to be a great support for the Veterans we care for. As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee. Please help us honor our Veterans by giving them the gift of your time.

Grace Healthcare Services is a Hospice organization that cares for patients throughout NJ. Veterans at the end of life. Volunteers are an essential component of this care. WHY A NEED FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS? -Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect to patients who have served our country. -Veterans share a common bond and code of conduct. -The camaraderie that exists between Veterans has proven to be a great support for the Veterans we care for. As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee. Please help us honor our Veterans by giving them the gift of your time.

Grace Healthcare Services is a Hospice organization that cares for patients throughout NJ. Veterans at the end of life. Volunteers are an essential component of this care. WHY A NEED FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS? -Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect to patients who have served our country. -Veterans share a common bond and code of conduct. -The camaraderie that exists between Veterans has proven to be a great support for the Veterans we care for. As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee. Please help us honor our Veterans by giving them the gift of your time.

Guiding Principles As a board member, I understand that I owe duties of care, loyalty, and obedience to the organization and the children it serves. The duty of care is the duty to monitor Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s activities, see that its mission is being accomplished, and guard its financial resources. The duty of loyalty is the duty to avoid conflicts of interest. The duty of obedience is to be faithful to Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s mission and to comply with the law. I will uphold these duties and do my utmost to ensure that Maya&rsquo;s Hope performs its mission and achieves its goals. Principal Commitments Act with integrity and represent the interests of all people served by the organization. Recognize that decisions of the board can be made only by a majority vote at a) a board meeting or b) in writing. Respect the majority decisions of the board. Participate in: Board self-evaluation programs. Board development workshops, seminars, and other educational events that enhance skills as a board member. Handle information with discretion and confidentiality as necessary. Exercise authority as a board member only when acting in a meeting with the full board or as delegated by the board with members. Collaborate with members who serve this board and leave personal prejudices out of all board discussions. Represent Maya&rsquo;s Hope in a positive and supportive manner at all times. Display courteous conduct at all board and committee meetings. Refrain from intruding on administrative issues that are the responsibility of management, except to monitor the results of the organization. Monitor the financial condition of the organization. Understand and comply with the bylaws of Maya&rsquo;s Hope. Avoid conflicts of interest between my position as a board member and my personal or professional life (as referenced in Maya&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;s Conflict of Interest Policy.) If such a conflict does arise, I will disclose that conflict to the board and refrain from voting on matters in which I have conflict. Liability of Board Members As a fully incorporated non-profit, Maya&rsquo;s Hope enjoys the same limited liability that any corporation does. Corporations offer the protection of limited liability to corporate directors and officers. Limited liability means that the organization's directors and officers have limited personal liability for business debts. Generally, creditors can only go after corporate assets and insurance to satisfy liabilities incurred by the corporation. This principle applies, however, only when the board has fulfilled its basic duties, such as the duty of care. A board member is legally bound to exercise reasonable care when he or she makes a decision for the organization. Reasonable care is what an 'ordinarily prudent' person in a similar situation would do. Examples of when a board member may have personal liability include (but are not limited to) when a board member: personally and directly injures someone. personally guarantees a bank loan or a business debt on which the corporation defaults, or behaves in a fraudulent or illegal manner that causes harm, Maya&rsquo;s Hope maintains a Directors & Officers liability insurance policy. Responsibilities of Secretary: Meeting Minutes The primary task of the secretary of an executive board is to record and maintain the minutes of each board meeting. Meeting minutes are detail reports that highlight the predetermined agenda of each conference as well as what actually took place. For example, a secretary may notate the following: \\\"The meeting began at 11 a.m. The first order of business was for the president to discuss potential changes to the organization&rsquo;s mission statement; however, he was unable to attend the gathering due to medical reasons. The issue was put on hold until a later date.\\\" Record Maintenance As the custodian of corporate records, the secretary of an executive board must maintain all company files in a manner compliant with organizational policies as well as any laws that regulate the industry. These documents may include the firm&rsquo;s article of incorporation, bylaws and employee contact lists, as well as financial records. He must also develop and enforce policies regarding access to these confidential files. Security controls, such as who can access which files and what approvals are needed to do so, are examples of the many procedures he must implement. Depending on the industry in which the company does business, the secretary of the executive board may be required to file certain documents with the government. For example, a nonprofit organization must meet certain criteria to maintain its tax-exempt status. It is often the responsibility of the secretary to ensure that all necessary paperwork is completed and returned to the Internal Revenue Service. Organizational Representative It is not uncommon for the secretary of an executive board to serve as its signing officer. This designation gives her the authority to sign documents, such as contracts, checks and credit applications, on behalf of the organization. Because this responsibility wields so much power, many firms implement a system of checks and balances so it is not abused. For instance, before signing a service agreement, the secretary may need the express written permission of two other board members. She must follow these guidelines or risk termination and, in severe cases, criminal prosecution.", "title": "Board Member Opening at Maya's Hope", "zipcode": "10001", "link": "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volunteermatch.org%2Fresults%2Fopp_detail.jsp%3Foppid%3D2862432%26apiAccountName%3Dnycmap%26isPublicProgramKey%3Dtrue", "org": "Maya's Hope"}, {"end": null, "description": "Inspire girls to explore the possibilities of technology!

For each of 100 causes, we are researching potential philanthropic funders (individuals, corporations, and foundations) that might provide growth funding. Each dollar they provide, and which we invest in enhancing and marketing the site, is likely to generate a multiple of new dollars for the cause from money that would otherwise have been spent on fuzzy slippers and giant cans of popcorn.

A pioneering nonprofit, Heifer International, has shown that nonprofits can capture some of that money by making donations, given in a friend&rsquo;s name, feel like a present. It works! They raise $115 million a year this way. Imagine how much more gift money could be captured by nonprofits addressing popular causes, including your favorites. The challenge is that it is too daunting for most nonprofits to provide a gift-like experience: tangible donation opportunities, wish lists, gift registries, and personalized printed greeting cards. About www.ChangingThePresent.org Our nonprofit site provides a gift-like experience, which helps 400 leading nonprofits capture money normally spent on traditional presents. The NY Times called it an \\\"amazon.com of the nonprofit world.\\\" We are now about to invite all million nonprofits to join the site. We are also providing each with their own private, charitable gift sites so they can send supporters without exposing them to other nonprofits. See a sample: http://SampleNGO.GiftsForHumanity.org.

From laptop donation to deliver the laptops to the recipient schools, every step of the process is 100% by volunteer's goodwill. It has delivered more than 11,000 laptops to 1,300 schools in 130 countries (visit www.labdoo.org). We are doing a workshop for volunteers to come and help fix the laptops and install education softwares (we call this process \\\"Sanitation\\\"). It will be held at Columbia University in Morning Side, NYC (detail of the venue later). Volunteer will need to do the following: Bring at least 1 unused laptop - donation from yourself, friends, or colleagues. Do sanitation and transform the laptops to educational device! We will have technical team from Labdoo to help you run the laptop. If you attended a workshop previously, we will follow another method ( Labtix) to sanitize laptops this times if laptops have enough specs. Detail will be explained during the workshop. Laptop specs: Donate both the laptop and power cable. Most of the laptops are acceptable - Windows and Mac (but Intel chip, PowerPC will not work). No or minimal physical damage. Laptops have to be fully functional (keyboard, trackpad, monitor has to be fully functional). Imagine if you are a student at a school around the world who is receiving a Labdoo laptop. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be perfectly clean but think about the kind of laptop you want to receive to study! Who you are: Volunteers will not need to have technical skills (though it will be helpful if you have!) Passionate to help change the world better through education.

Often, regularly scheduled visits are requested, however Music Volunteers may also be asked to provide musical visits on an occasional basis for one patient/family or for a group of patients at a facility as outreach for the local hospice agency. Hospice is built on the philosophy that we care for our patients in mind, body and soul. Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, memory bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network. They often make phone calls to check up on family members and also send cards of comfort and care.

Whether you choose to work directly with patients and families or to volunteer in one of many other ways, you can make a profound difference in someone's life, including your own. Volunteers are an integral part of the hospice team. Volunteer Opportunities: Companionship Volunteers work directly with patients providing companionship, offering friendly visits, reading to patients, writing letters, offering a gentle touch or sharing a quiet moment. Complementary Volunteers are certified/trained professionals who can provide complementary modalities of reflexology, music, imagery and touch therapies such as Reiki, massage, therapeutic touch and healing hands. Pet Therapy Volunteers provide certified/trained pets who visit with patients. These animals provide loving memories for some and give unconditional love helping our patients feel connected to a larger world. Administrative Volunteers provide help to the staff in our Edison office by assisting with typing, addressing cards, organizing newsletters, creating packets, collating manuals and other varied clerical duties Craft Volunteers consist of individuals or groups who touch patients in a special way by making lap blankets, shawls, huggable dolls/bears and other articles for patients to enjoy. Junior Volunteers consist of groups such as girl/boy scouts or young people who wish to honor our patients by making holiday cards, posters, wall hangings and memory books. Bereavement Volunteers offer support to the families and friends of patients who have passed. During the grieving process the bereavement volunteer can be a valuable resource, especially for those who lack a solid support network.

Why Take the Challenge? While we have made great progress in reducing incidence and death rates of those 50 or older over the last decade through the prevention and early detection of colorectal cancer through screening - the simple fact is colorectal cancer is still the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death. And, incidence rates and death of those under 50 have increased at an alarming rate each year. In 2018 over 135,000 (estimated) Americans will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer and over 50,000 Americans will lose their battle with the disease. Most frustrating is the fact that most of these cases could be prevented with early detection. If caught early the 5 year survival rate is 90%. Where do the funds raised go? Funds raised by teams and individuals helps provide: Free educational materials and our participation in outreach events in communities around the country; A national tour of our educational inflatable colon - the Rollin&rsquo; Colon; Local, state, national and global programs that promote colorectal cancer prevention and early detection; Awards to young colorectal cancer investigators presenting at the world&rsquo;s premier societies and conferences; Funding to support the nation&rsquo;s ONLY Summit focused on early age onset colorectal cancer. The Colon Cancer Challenge offers survivors, and family and friends of those affected by colorectal cancer, a unique opportunity to raise public awareness and contribute to the fight against this often fatal, yet preventable disease.

WHY A NEED FOR VETERAN VOLUNTEERS? -Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect to patients who have served our country. -Veterans share a common bond and code of conduct. -The camaraderie that exists between Veterans has proven to be a great support for the Veterans we care for. As a member of the New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, Grace Healthcare has made a unique commitment to all Veterans by participating in a partnership with the US Department of Veteran Affairs. This is known as the, \\\"We Honor Veterans\\\" initiative. The We Honor Veterans initiative recognizes that only a small percentage of Veterans are a part of the VA Healthcare system and therefore aren't always aware of benefits that they might be entitled to. As part of this venture, our goal is to raise awareness within the veteran community. Once a Veteran comes on service with us, our priority is to give them the recognition they deserve as well as help to insure that all benefits they may be entitled to are accessed. We believe that involves interaction with Veteran volunteers who have had similar life experiences. As a Grace Volunteer you will be given a choice of assignment depending on your desire to provide bedside visits, or office based assignments or to become part of our Veteran Speaker Committee. Please help us honor our Veterans by giving them the gift of your time.
